			 <p>A blog post can just <em>end</em>.</p>
<p>Informality is an advantage, most days.</p>
<p>And, being an amateur.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re all terrified of being revealed as amateurs, but in fact, today it is the amateur—the enthusiast who pursues her work in the spirit of love (in French, the word means “lover”), regardless of the potential for fame, money, or career—who often has the advantage over the professional. Because they have little to lose, amateurs are willing to try anything and share the results. They take chances, experiment, and follow their whims. Sometimes, in the process of doing things in an unprofessional way, they make new discoveries. “In the beginner’s mind, there are many possibilities,” said Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki. “In the expert’s mind, there are few.”</p>

			 <p>I am told that you can enter thousands of words in a note attached to a task in Things. This seems like an esoteric and unconventional bit of trivia, Things being a task management app, not one of the likely candidates for a “second brain.” My pal Brian Bailey knows the exact number:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My to-dos in Things are often prompts to think and write, such as a post, short story, or planning for a new year. That’s when I normally switch to iA Writer. But recently, I started to wonder why. The to-do in Things usually has notes, initial bullet points, or maybe a draft intro. I often find myself switching back and forth between them.</p>
<p>— Brain Bailey, <a href="https://bb.place/focused-writing-in-things/">Focused Writing in Things</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’ll have to read the exact number in his post. 😉</p>
<p>Things is one of the apps I had in mind when I wrote about <a href="https://therealadam.com/2025/06/02/i-was-talking-to-a.html">humble shopkeepers of software</a>. It is, nearly two decades on, nearly complete software. I love that.</p>
<p>Would I love to see them go all the way and add notes, applying their characteristically well considered, high standards of <a href="https://therealadam.com/2025/09/03/feel-fast-function-form.html">function, form, and feel</a>? Absolutely. Would it make it even harder for me to stick with a notes app I’m already using? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Am I a little worried they might slip and mess up something nearly perfect as-is? Also, yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that there is an ebb and flow to how I use different tools. Sometimes, I want to consolidate to as few as possible, other times I love having one that specializes in each piece of the puzzle, like an outliner. For now, I&rsquo;m enjoying going to Things for what&rsquo;s next, then staying there to actually work on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current status: trying to consolidate tools, so I waffle between them less often. I so want to be the person who is happy with only a few applications to do all of their things. Yet, I am, repeatedly, not that person.</p>

			 <p>The CSS rediscovery continues!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then, a few years ago, I read a blog post by Josh W Comeau called <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/">My Custom CSS Reset</a>. I realized that there’s no deep magic; everything a reset does is just normal CSS that you can read and understand.</p>
<p>— Jake Lazaroff, <a href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/my-modern-css-reset/%20">My Modern CSS Reset</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have only copypasta’d other folks’ (thanks, <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/">Eric Meyer</a>) reset code, assuming it’s deep CSS tricks that I didn’t <em>want</em> to understand. But Jake’s is an easy read, particularly if you read through his post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suppose it kind of blurs the line between “CSS reset” and “classless CSS framework”. My goal isn’t really to adhere to a strict definition of either one; I’ve just found this set of styles to be a good starting point for most websites I build.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>Polyglot runtimes have arrived and fizzled throughout my <em>stage whisper</em> 25-year career. Supporting multiple programming languages without reducing them to an uninteresting lowest common denominator has proven wildly difficult.</p>
<p>That is, most multi-language runtimes are <em>one</em> of: “you can use any language, as long as you conform to Java-style OO”, “any language can run in a browser as long as it quacks like a DOM manipulation written in JavaScript”, or “bring your favorite languages, as long as it conforms to conventions invented for C sometime in the 1970s”.</p>
<p>It’s wild, to me, that the solution to “I want to re-use singular code that solves my problem but is not in the language I’m using” may end up being “use an LLM to rewrite it wholesale into your language of choice”. 🤷‍♂️</p>

			 <p>📚_The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet_, Becky Chambers</p>
<p>I’ve read three of Chambers’ books now and would characterize them as “comfy sci-fi”. In the best possible way! There’s a spaceship with many sapient species making up its crew. There are stakes and adventures, but they aren’t galactic in scale or epic in drama. It’s a nice reprieve from the cold-eyed intensity of, e.g., Herbert.</p>
<p>This one is a “found family” sort of outing. Our crew has a few adventures, but they are secondary to the relationships and connections formed. Again, it’s an enjoyable change of pace from what I normally read. I love a hero’s journey dotted with encrypted deck-of-cards messaging and “what if computers were exceptionally competent <em>and</em> evil?” plot lines. But I think it’s good to read about relationships and “what if birds and apes were sapient and worked together in deep space?” too. 😆</p>

			 <p>Granted, quality of idea matters. The worst idea executed swiftly and repeatedly is still probably the worst idea. But it’s hard to know, with ideas, when you’ve got a winner or not. Hence, the power of iteration.</p>

<p>There are many ways to turn a good idea into great work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate one immaculate idea, get it done, get it out there, promote it relentlessly.</li>
<li>Have ten good ideas, try them all quickly, put the best idea out there, pursue the one or two that seem most promising.</li>
<li>Have one hundred ideas of wildly varying goodness, try them at a fantastic pace, see which one sticks.</li>
</ul>
<p>For better or worse, the world we live in favors the last one. The person with one great idea is often not the person who is known for great work. Unless they’re lucky, persistent, or both!</p>
<p>(Once you’ve got that good idea, you still need <a href="https://therealadam.com/2025/09/03/feel-fast-function-form.html">The Quality</a>.)</p>
<p>Allow me an idiomatic metaphor: “Good Vibrations” was a whopper of a good idea but took 7 months to record. <em>Most</em> albums take far less time than that to record (not you, Bruce Springsteen), contain 8-12 songs, and 1-2 songs stand out. Today, you can slop out one hundred songs with AI and if any of them are listened to more than a couple times it’s a big success.</p>
<p>Of the many “All you need is attention, context, cheese-whiz” sort of papers out there, the unsung hero is “All you need is billions upon billions of iterations.”</p>
<p>Hence, evolution and all of human creativity as well! It only took hundreds of light bulbs and dozens of airplanes before Edison or the Wright Brothers found the one that works.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>More accessible does not mean success comes more easily or more work will have higher quality. Accessibility is orthogonal to magnitude and density of quality.</p>
<p>For any creative endeavor, this is true. Axiomatically, if you make something easier, you’re lowering the cost of entry. This applies to average creators as much as potential superstars like Mozart, Carmack, or Einstein.</p>
<p>If you make it easier to do, less devoted, determined, or talented people will do it. More people means you will see more volume, making “merely” average work seem more common. The work you observe might also be more uniform or bland, since making something accessible often means many folks are starting from similar templates or boilerplates.</p>
<p>This might sound a bit elitist. But, I think there’s plenty of room to produce great work without elite skill. ZZ Top and AC/DC are far less sophisticated, and their members less talented, than Prince or Van Halen, but still produce work that carries an appeal of its own.</p>
<p>The same applies to software. You don’t need a room full of doctorates to produce excellent software, you don’t need a master of arcana to produce fast software, and you don’t need a transcendent genius to solve someone’s problem in a well-considered product.</p>

			 <p>Look at this bit of CSS. For greatest effect, imagine sending it yourself from ten or fifteen years ago, or the first time you hit upon a limitation in browser compatibility or looked at someone else’s stylesheet and wondered “what the heck is going on here and what’s a <a href="https://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/highpass.html">high-pass filter</a>?”</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/151691/2025/ray-so-export.png" alt="CSS in 2025 is pretty good!"></p>
<p>Marvel at all the things that are <em>just there</em>, no hacks or preprocessors or compilers required. Gradients, animations, input states. CSS has grown into the open-ended, declarative, and compatible system it always wanted to be. I dare say that CSS is (finally?) hitting its mark.</p>
<p>Can Ruby, JS, Python, C#, Java, etc. make a similar claim? Particularly in expanding the capability with, AFAICT, only superficial syntactic changes and adding new rules.</p>
<p>Can you still use Python from ten years ago, add new functionality to a Ruby program with a keyword, or use new features in JavaScript across all runtimes? Were it only true! (Where it’s not, there are usually pretty good reasons, to be fair.)</p>
<p>Based on tinkering with SwiftUI lately: this beats configuring views. Even when I’m building both with the help of Spicy AI Auto-complete. 😉</p>

<p>Everyone loves a little faster, even if they say they want more function or nitpick on the form. But not everyone asks for it to <em>feel great</em>. That’s what distinguishes the good from the great and the great from the sublime.</p>

<p>It has to feel great, feel quick, have the right functions, and pleasing forms. In that order of importance.</p>
<p>I’ll excuse anyone if they’re not a transcendent genius who can create things exhibiting those qualities in that order and every time they sit down to build. But when you can get all four of those things together, even in small quantities, then you’ve got something special.</p>

			 <p>When leading projects, in any capacity, avoid startling your colleagues. Tech leads, engineering managers, product managers, etc. need to keep peers and stakeholders informed. When there are successes, let them know. When risks are discovered, communicate the steps taken to mitigate them. When setbacks occur, indicate how it will affect the remaining scope and schedule of the project. <a href="https://therealadam.com/2025/08/22/dig-out-not-up.html">Dig out, not up.</a></p>
<p>Stakeholders and peers are startled when they think a project is smooth sailing only to hear the ship is sinking. When things go poorly, projects slip by inches, then feet, then all of a sudden. It’s on project leaders to detect these slips, address the root causes, <em>and</em> let people interested in the project know what’s going on and what you’re doing about it.</p>
<p>This may seem obvious! But it’s easy to get so wrapped up in solving the problem that you forget to communicate the problem. To want to say, with ease, “things aren’t going great, but I have it under control.” Or, to feel like the issue is yours alone and forget you may have peers in the organization that could help if only you communicated it.</p>
<p>A non-obvious way to surprise people is to silently, but suddenly, succeed. Release new features or change functionality in production without any kind of internal notice or documentation, and I’ll bet you hear something from customer support, marketing, sales, etc. They won’t begrudge you for doing your job and shipping code, but they might ask you to please let us know next time so we can prepare our teams, campaigns, or update our documentation. Or, they might come at you with pitchforks, wanting to know why things are changing out from under them.</p>
<p>Corollary: <a href="https://therealadam.com/2021/11/01/dont-be-spooky.html">Don’t Be Spooky</a>. If you need to tell someone, IC or stakeholder, that a project has run into surprises, just tell them. Don’t open up with context-free messages like “can we talk?”</p>
<p>Have the hard conversation now, before it gets tougher.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Late projects stay late.</strong> It’s terrifically rare to “catch up” on a late project. When projects run late, it’s because you’ve missed something in your original estimate: you’ve guessed that work will take <code>x</code> days, but it’s taking <code>1.5x</code>, or whatever. For you to “catch up”, your estimate would have to be wrong about the rest of the project, but <em>in the opposite direction</em>. Even if you correct what led to the overrun, it’s terrifically unlikely that you’ll somehow make up time.</p>
<p>— Jacob Kaplan-Moss</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t tell people you will get back on schedule by working harder or having better luck. As Jacob points out, there’s already evidence that your team’s capacity or luck aren’t harmonizing with your existing estimates and hopes!</p>
<p>Instead, talk about scope/time trade-offs that one could make to focus on what’s most important. Share the results of retrospectives.</p>
<p><em>Attempt</em> to explain how you got here in the first place. Caveat, you’re unlikely to fully explain how a software project surprised you on the first attempt. You’re working from an estimate, a projection from wildly incomplete information. Now you have slightly more information, but still an incomplete model. (You won’t have a complete model until you finish the project, sadly.)</p>
<p>Share how you <em>might</em> avoid this surprise in the future. Caveat, the remedy is often worse than the disease. Particularly in software development, if we attempted to prevent or foresee every possible illness, the project would barely get off the ground before it was cancelled. See also: agile software projects accidentally reinvent waterfall when they seek to add more predictability and remove risk/surprises from the process.</p>

<p>Rocco Prestia and Doc Kupka of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0TUGeT9uUk">Tower of Power</a> are great examples. Prestia’s bass lines are percussive and precise but counter-melodic.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The last 10% of any creative act is the hard part. (Previously: <a href="https://therealadam.com/2024/06/14/finishing-is-the.html">Finishing is a skill</a>.) You had an idea, thought it would take X days, only to find X-1 days of all these other things that have to be done. That’s functional scope creep.</p>
<p>Finishing, actually getting the draft or project out of your computer and out into the world, that’s a whole other list of things. Lots of work, and surprises, are lurking here. Call it delivery scope creep. Or a finishing tax. And, it’s a mental challenge, getting over the “they’re all gonna laugh at you” fear. (But not in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They%27re_All_Gonna_Laugh_at_You!">Adam Sandler</a> way.)</p>
<p>The more steps you can remove from putting something out there, the more you can put out there. (There’s always money in the shovel stand.) Ergo, the continuous development of new systems and tools to make online publishing easier, despite the market having excited for nearly three decades.</p>
<p>Related, <a href="https://x.com/Pinboard/status/761656824202276864">the programmers’ credo</a>: “we do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy.” So goes software, so goes any other creative endeavor.</p>
<hr>
<p>Writing words and writing code feel similar, for me. (And, playing a musical instrument, if I go far back enough.) They are equal parts mechanical performance, exercise of taste, and act of creation. For all of them, I want to be in a flow state. I want to go as deep as I can, time permitting. I want to hold a whole world in my head. I want to work among as many details, as deeply as possible.</p>
<p>Finishing, whether it&rsquo;s releasing software or publishing an essay, reviewing code, or editing and revising words, are a different skillset. Differently creative, but still putting something new into existence. There’s a nice symmetry there. If you can get good at editing and revising words, you can get good at editing and revising code.</p>
<hr>
<p>Getting over the last 90% of any kind of project, whether code or words or music, is the same skill.</p>
<p>It’s like the last 90% of anything is just a mindset, almost a resilience of mind. If you can get good at one, the skill carries over into anything that requires finishing.</p>
<p>It feels like life pulls a fast one on us, at times. “What got us here, won’t get us there”. Making the software, essay, or music is different from shipping, publishing, or releasing it. But if you can get good at any one of shipping, publishing, or releasing, you are considerably further ahead on getting good at the other two.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://ruby.social/@therealadam/114631806988575242">The winning scenario for agent-assisted code, design, science, etc. is humans having more time to do creative and impactful thinking</a> because computers/LLMs do the tedious setup, easily verified work, and gather preliminary materials that humans turn into inventions.</p>
<p>FWIW, I don’t think the worst scenarios are likely. The future isn’t atrophying literacy rates or people turning off their brains to tell LLMs what to do. It’s probably not Malthusian job scarcity or Keynesian leisure abundance, either.</p>
<p>The best outcome, IMO, is that producing almost-good-enough software, design, science, etc. is possible for more people, particularly those without specialist degrees.</p>
<p>You won’t have gym owners producing billion dollar SaaS companies, but they might produce software good enough to run their business without needing to contract out to a software developer.</p>
<p>You won’t have software developers producing the same level of design and art direction you see in major films. You might see them producing design good enough and sufficiently distinct that they can wait to bring a designer on until they’ve found their market.</p>
<p>You won’t have writers discovering new axioms of math and science, but you might see them correctly apply statistics and physics so that stories about finance and space battles are slightly more realistic.😉</p>
<p>In short: experts in topic A won’t find themselves held back by having an idea that requires expertise in topic A <em>and</em> topic B, where topic B is too deep for them to “just get good at”. Fewer Wozniaks will have to find their Steve Jobs, fewer Springsteens will have to find their Landaus.</p>
<p>It won’t exactly be <a href="https://therealadam.com/2025/05/09/the-web-and-blogs-are.html">you can just do stuff</a>. But, perhaps you can get far enough along that collaborators to fill in the specialties you don’t can find you.</p>

<p>So, if you read through the Philokalia, it is very common to find the same author alternating between talking of thoughts (logismoi here referring to negative, vicious thoughts that could lead you astray) and demons. Acedia, the vice of listlessness and despondency, is called, for instance, ‘the noonday demon.’ Sometimes it is treated as an internal struggle; other times it reads as if a personified demon is the cause of these temptations; if Graiver is right, then these are merely two ways of experiencing and conceptualizing the same phenomenon.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the course of two experiments within two half-day coding sessions, I better glimpsed what working with coding agents might look like over the next couple of years.</p>
<h2 id="1-i-teach-the-agent-to-build-a-simple-rails-cms">1. I teach the agent to build a simple Rails CMS</h2>
<p>This is pretty unremarkable, given my experience. But, like so many lately, I wanted more reps at exploring agent coding workflows. In particular: what works for guiding an agent and keeping it on-track?</p>
<p>I did a bit of the upfront setup <a href="https://therealadam.com/2025/07/09/yesterday-i-coded-with-only.html">with wits alone</a>. Executing the correct boilerplate is where our LLM assistants seem to most reliably get themselves into early trouble. Plus, Rails’ whole thing is accelerating this part of a project. If somehow it were slow-going, it would be a tremendous failing of the framework. But it wasn’t!</p>
<p>Next, I set up the basic models I wanted for this particular little CMS. Again, a way that an LLM often goes off the path is trying to build new models <em>just</em> right. So I did that part myself. Perhaps, this is also where I’m most opinionated about getting things right. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<p>Finally, I made sure the app had good guardrails in place. Namely, <a href="https://jmduke.com/posts/post/justfile/"><code>Justfile</code> tasks</a> to run tests, <code>rubocop</code> checks, and <code>brakeman</code>. Claude Code seems to do really well given those kinds of guidance, so setting them up up-front makes sense.</p>
<p>From there, I let the machine take the wheel. I gave it brief instructions, sometimes using plan mode to build up context first, and let it go. Document and element model CRUD, done. Tweaking a <a href="https://daisyui.com">DaisyUI</a> theme to look a little more Swiss design or Bauhaus-y, done. Build up a document editor that works with the document <em>and</em> element models at the same time, done.</p>
<p>Result: taking a little time up-front to lay the right foundation and guardrails makes agent coding way better.</p>
<h2 id="2-the-agent-teaches-me-about-llm-evals">2. The agent teaches me about LLM evals</h2>
<p>This one is (unintentionally) the opposite of what I was doing with Claude and Rails. In that case, I was working with Claude as the expert, guiding it towards an outcome I knew was easily within reach for this project.</p>
<p>For this project, I was experimenting with using Claude to teach me how to do <a href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/field-guide/index.html">LLM evals</a>. My understanding is that these are super important for building AI-based apps; they are as close as you can get to a TDD-style feedback loop to verify your work when working with nondeterministic language models.</p>
<p>To start, I used Claude (not Code) and asked for a starting point to learn LLM evals. I wanted to get something simplistic, like a hello world of that problem domain. I would rather not set up multiple ML frameworks (looking at you, Conda), so I said let me run these models locally, and I’m fine with using Python.</p>
<p>Claude generated some Python code, which I pasted into a new <code>uv</code> project and got started. From this point forward, I was using Claude Code to restructure code, like moving code into source files out of Jupiter notebooks or putting code plus explanations back into Jupiter notebooks. I’d also ask why a particular approach was taken or what jargon means.</p>
<p>In this case, I was really using Claude code to teach myself something new, and it was the expert guiding me. For something like this where I’m not caught up in the specifics of machine learning and its problem domain, it’s a perfect approach.</p>
<p>Result: I got way ahead on a new-to-me topic over the course of a couple of hours.</p>
<h2 id="3--at-the-same-time">3. 💥 At the same time</h2>
<p>The big reveal is, I was working on these two projects at the same time. Two terminal tabs, two Claude Code instances. “Talk” to the first one, let it run while I talk to the second one. First one finishes, talk to it, rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>At first, this was like pairing with two developers working on entirely different projects. And they’re sitting on either side of me, sometimes attempting to talk at the same time. My brain hurt and it felt like I was moving slow enough that single-tasking would have been far more effective.</p>
<p>After 60 minutes or so, things seemed to pick up. I felt like I was doing a better job of bouncing back-and-forth between the two agents. I was quickly improving my prompts, allowing the agents to work more effectively while I was working with the other agent. However, I wouldn’t say I mastered multitasking in one hour. More like, I came to grips with keeping each agent going, like keeping a room full of eager developers moving independently despite needing frequent directions.</p>
<p>It’s still crucial to taste test the work frequently. Product-focused developers/managers will have a leg up here because they’re used to working this way. I think anyone who has good attention to detail and the ability to communicate what they want is going to have an advantage here.</p>
<p>From all this, I learned a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working with agents is going to look similar to multitasking and delegation.</li>
<li>To keep up with multitasking, humans will need to get as good at context management as agents (we both have limited context windows).</li>
<li>Often, we’ll mentor agents to get the best results, particularly by giving them good guardrails (automated and dynamic context generation).</li>
<li>In some cases, the agents can teach us just enough to get stuff done.</li>
<li>For better or worse, there’s still much to explore, and the frontier is moving quickly.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>📚Currently reading:</p>
<p>Ursula LeGuin, <em>The Language of the Night</em>. A series of essays about writing, science fiction, and LeGuin’s own works. The only novel of hers read is <em>The Dispossesed</em>, but I’m enjoying the heck out of her non-fiction writing and thinking. It’s pretty timely, despite being fifty years old in most cases. Bonus points for LeGuin being a longtime Portland, Oregon resident as well. And, now I really want to read essays and short non-fiction from other favorites like Vonnegut, Stephenson, etc.</p>
<p>James Gleick, <em>Genius</em>. Gleick isn’t quite Caro, but his non-fiction writing really pops. And how could it not, with a subject like Feynman?</p>
<p>Frank Herbert, <em>Children of Dune</em>. <em>Messiah</em> was a bit short, and felt like nothing happened, even though it rather upends the story you’re expecting to get. This one feels like a bunch of scheming and setting of the dramatic tables. Not as much world building as the original <em>Dune</em>. Unsure if I’m up for reading all six of these books. I’ve heard it gets even weirder though!</p>
<p>Craig Mod, <em>Things Become Other Things</em>. I’m, obviously, a huge fan of Craig’s writing. There’s less “meta” about the actual walking in this one. More of an interwoven story of Mod’s childhood friend, observations of the people and places he meets whilst walking, and his own life story. It’s a lovely bit of memoir.</p>

Back to re-thinking <a href="https://buttondown.com/therealadam/archive/lets-talk-about-format/">the format</a> on that one.</p>
<p><a href="https://therealadam.com/2025/04/17/for-circa-adam-two-of.html">“It ships because it’s 11:30am”</a> was useful in setting that streak. But “focus on the 2 or 3 most important things, let everything else sit sadly in the corner” is also a handy regimen. In this case: 1) job searching, 2) get a newsletter out there consistently.</p>
<p>Courtney and I are heads-down at furnishing and tidying our basement, so folks can visit. I’m going to count that work as a win for “building things”, even though it’s not software or writing.📈</p>

			 <p>A few reflections on what I’ve been building (with) lately:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/">llm</a> is great for prototyping many kinds of workflows. If you’re thinking “I’d like to build an app with some intelligence” and “I don’t mind tinkering with CLI apps”, give it a go. In particular, <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html">templates</a> and <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/schemas.html">fragments</a> are very useful for assembling the rudiments of problem solution.</li>
<li>Part and parcel with using <code>llm</code>, I’m tinkering with locally runnable models via <a href="https://ollama.com">Ollama</a>. On my M3 MacBook Pro with 24 GB of total memory, <a href="https://ollama.com/library/qwen3">Qwen3</a> and <a href="https://ollama.com/library/mistral">Mistral</a> are small enough to fit into GPU memory and run pretty quickly. With “thinking” disabled (the open models will spend <em>many</em> tokens talking to themselves!), they are fast enough for development work and experimentation. They definitely aren’t at the same level as the latest from Anthropic or OpenAI. But, the future is promising for using these smaller models instead of relying on metered API access for <em>every single</em> token of intelligence.</li>
<li>Putting those two together, I’m hacking out some tools to help with <a href="https://github.com/therealadam/llm-templates">job search</a>. My goal is to reduce the effort to see if a job description matches what I’m looking for, generate ideas for customizing a cover letter to the role, and provide useful answers for any pre-interview questions. Next step: put an actual UI on my <code>llm</code>-based prototype.</li>
<li>To wit: I’m studying up on Python, FastAPI, HTMX, etc. by asking Claude Code to write learning projects and then asking it questions about why it wrote them that way. Turns out, this helps me with language idioms and library setup pitfalls. Wild times!</li>
</ul>

			 <p>A thing about homeownership is that every room is a workshop until it becomes whatever room it’s going to be.</p>
<p>This seems to hold for brand-new homes and old homes. Sometimes, for rooms you’ve been using one way for years, and now you want to use them for a different purpose. Or, because you suddenly get intensely bored with their current layout.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Numbers are not the goal. Successful outcomes are.</p>
<p>Those footing the bill would rather have a successful outcome than an excuse to blame the estimator. In exploring better estimation, I’m not looking to protect the estimator or development organization from censure or litigation after a disappointment. Instead, we use estimation to help guide the project to success from the point of view of both those paying for development and those performing it.</p>
<p>— George Dinwiddie, <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/gdestimate/software-estimation-without-guessing/">Software Estimation Without Guessing</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I’m feeling lousy about an estimate, it’s usually because I’m treating it like a promise instead of what it actually is: a piece of the puzzle for deciding what to do next.</p>
<p>The tricky bit is setting expectations up front: this estimate is based on what we know today, not what we’ll discover tomorrow. Everyone knows surprises will happen. The estimate should help the team make better decisions when they do, not box them into promises they can’t keep.</p>
<p>The best estimates I’ve given weren’t the most accurate—they were the ones that helped teams navigate uncertainty instead of pretending it away.</p>

			 <p>Folks are ruffled that LLMs, even without tool use, are pretty good at coding interview challenges. How will we even know who is good at coding anymore? (Current hypothesis: by <a href="https://therealadam.com/2025/03/13/every-career-step-is-searching.html">collaborating with them as early as possible</a>.)</p>
<p>Friend, I am here to tell you that LLMs are not the problem. The issue is we were evaluating programmers on speed and competency through the tedious parts of programming. If we ever looked for what makes a programmer <em>effective</em>, it was accidentally. 🫠</p>
<hr>
<p>In retrospect, we had mediocre insight into what activities are effective use of a programmer’s time. At best, we were using a metric from decades ago, when knowledge of algorithms was rare and solving arcane puzzles <em>was</em> more valuable. The past twenty years of human knowledge accumulation, into reusable libraries, on the web and then distilled into language models, has obviated much of that work.</p>
<p>That’s not even counting all the tedium we didn’t even realize we created. Generating projects with their dependencies and libraries all lined up just the right way (looking at you, C and JavaScript ecosystems), upgrading those libraries, configuring our development environments, accreting unruly towers of software dependencies that grew an industry (software supply chain management), even the seemly simple task of “commit my work to the correct branch and fix things up when I realize I was on the wrong branch when I committed”. 🙃 All of that tedium is required toil for successfully developing software, but none of it contributes to solving problems for people.</p>
<hr>
<p>The wrong insight here is that developers will be replaced by LLMs that can quickly implement a linked list. (And much more, if you supervise them well enough.) Maybe the 10x developers were really only good at tedium or algorithm tests. 🌶️</p>
<p>A better insight is that Leetcode and similar schemes were probably never that great. But, they were easier (and perhaps better on average🤷‍♂️) than developing a well-considered coding exercise yourself. Silver lining: it’s an object lesson that you don’t need the best product to succeed in the market.</p>
<p>The best insight: way more of software development is tedium than we previously guessed. And, it’s within our grasp to automate those bits away. If we can reclaim the parts of our brains that remember arcane shell commands or know how to rebase our way out of a sticky git conundrum, all the better.</p>

			 <p>Communicating early and often is a great hack, and easy to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, write the docs you want to write. If no one reads them, or if readers find they are out of date, then consider not writing them next time. But don’t let anyone shame you into wasting time. The question is not, “Do you have documentation?” but rather, “Do you communicate clearly?”</p>
<p>– Kent Beck <a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/the-documentation-tradeof">The Documentation Tradeoff</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Write documentation” is a tidy but unsubtle maxim. “Tell people what you did” and “help people use your software for the right thing” are better starts. Of late, “invest in written documentation for onboarding humans <em>and</em> agents” is an even better suggestion.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re telling people that your thing exists, here&rsquo;s when you should use it, and here&rsquo;s how to use it, your documentation bases are covered.</p>

			 <p>LLMs (and agent coding tools in particular) love a fitness function. Give them a tool that indicates success or failure and they&rsquo;ll go to town. Compiler errors, linter warnings—they love that stuff.</p>
<p>They also seem to love deleting failing tests—maybe they&rsquo;re more human than we&rsquo;d like. 😅</p>
<p>Never before has the exit status of Unix commands been so important—the clarity of errors, logging messages, and progress displays are all suddenly crucial. Well-written text, whether it&rsquo;s a prompt, error, or informative log message, nudges LLMs towards the right next step just like it would for a human.</p>
<p>Any task with a decent fitness function—an LLM will handle it soon. Currently, they&rsquo;re limited by human response times and gumption. But once we&rsquo;re confident enough in their performance and the safeguards we&rsquo;ve put up, a lot of them will be out there, just doing stuff and starting tasks based on what they predict needs doing.

			 <p>AKA &ldquo;Help! I estimated a project and hit every branch falling down the surprises tree.&rdquo; A shocking turn of events that definitely has never happened to any of us.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry too hard when it turns out estimates weren&rsquo;t accurate. They were optimistic guesses based on incomplete information and optimism that everything would go right—which it rarely does.</p>
<p>Do communicate to your stakeholders. Tell people whose work depends on your project about delays as soon as you know. Communicate now instead of waiting for the next scheduled update.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let your team think they have failed. If they executed well but surprises came up, tell them so explicitly. If they aren&rsquo;t executing well, address that separately.</p>
<p>Do re-evaluate your plan with fresh estimates. If the deadline is fixed, cut scope. You can&rsquo;t count on catching up by working smarter or having better luck.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask people to work harder or longer to catch up. There&rsquo;s no catching up, only keeping pace, reducing scope, or slipping the deadline.</p>

			 <p>I was talking to a pal about how some software developers are able to operate in a sort of timeless way. If contemporary tech, the stuff that made “tech people” the antagonist, is on one end of the spectrum, these developers are all the way over on the other end.</p>
<p>Picture a sleepy strip mall: grocery store, clothing store, paint store (why is there always a paint store?), and then, improbably, a software store. Inside, a proud but humble proprietor.</p>
<p>“What do you have for sale?”, you ask.</p>
<p>“One application, available on two or three platforms, you can buy ‘em all for less than $99”, they reply.</p>
<p>“You got anything else?”</p>
<p>“Nope, just this one program.”</p>
<p>Maybe you buy it, maybe you ask a few questions. Either way, the owner heads back to the workshop and keeps at their thing.</p>
<p>It makes an okay living. There are a couple of other people back in the workshop, helping to fix bugs, add minor new features, and keep things moving along. But it hasn’t grown to planet scale, doesn’t require astronomical growth to make payroll and pay holiday bonuses.</p>
<p>I’ve conveniently left out all the other small business things they have to do: accounting, marketing, so many kinds of insurance, budgeting, etc. Small businesses are all alike in that way.</p>
<p>It’s really great that the curious shop in the strip mall of the web, the personal website, continues to forge ahead. Maybe you call it a blog, a <a href="https://blogroll.org/">webring</a>, a portfolio site, whatever. It’s still out there, doesn’t need astronomical growth to satisfy end-game finance or investors.

<p>This is about organizing and cutting, not productivity. It may sound like weird tricks for squeezing the last bit out of every hour, but it’s not. It’s about developing the ability to do more of the good stuff so you can keep energy in reserve for when it matters.</p>
<p>A lot of the thinking about how to maintain a great system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">lists</a>, tasks, emails, <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com">notes</a> and supporting material is crafting a <a href="https://therealadam.com/2025/05/26/i-miss-writing-do-not.html">DO NOT ERASE</a> system for that one Truly Awesome Idea. Trouble is, they save too many Just Okay Ideas that crowd out the Truly Awesome Ideas.</p>
<p>Our brains have so many ways to erase an idea. Sleep consolidates memories, sometimes indiscreetly. We say something true or brilliant but have to move on to the next calendar event or get back to our routine before we can write it down. Or we simply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doorway_effect">walk through a door</a>. Suddenly the idea is gone. Memory consolidation is our brain’s editing process. And mostly, it works!</p>
<p>Offloading mental burden to lists is a great hack, on balance. But develop and sharpen your brain’s natural forgetting process too. Every idea can’t be a winner.</p>

			 <p>On one hand, there’s the classical music <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogues_of_classical_compositions?wprov=sfti1">catalog</a> mode of blogging. This is a bookmark, that’s a note, a photo here, a link there, an essay when I’m feeling ambitious. Étude, sonata, variations on a theme. Framing the writing by its scale and shape. A taxonomist’s delight.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Jack White sort of blogging: <a href="https://youtu.be/r_F7aiOvdwE?si=hlL3nO2YtujN5G5O">here’s a thing, I made it</a>. The edges weren’t worked down too much, the roughness is still there. It preserves the energy and spirit of the idea more than it tries to explore the idea to its logical end. Better to cut ideas too soon than coddle them.</p>

<p>It’s all a matter of perspective. To a kernel developer who thinks about bytes on a wire or spinning a disk to read a file, <code>git</code> is incredibly high-level. 🙃 To a Smalltalk developer, files on disk are low-level (I assume).</p>

<li>The second (and final) season of <em>Andor</em> was spectacular. The best Star War of the past ten years, IMO.</li>

<li>I’m surprised how much I look forward to <em>The Studio</em> every week. Highly recommended, even if Seth Rogen isn’t your thing.</li>
<li>S4 of <em>Hacks</em> plays up tension between the leads more than I’d like. Otherwise, the writing and performances are excellent.</li>
<li>Reserving judgement on S1 of <em>Murderbot</em>. The first episode did not grab me, but the second was an improvement.</li>
<li>Upcoming: Not sure how I feel about <em>The Bear</em>. But, my feelings won’t change how award shows go, so maybe I should just go with it. 🤷🏻‍♂️</li>

<p>Consider replacing &ldquo;slopping out code&rdquo; with a more specific term like &ldquo;generating excessive code&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently, Monsieur Model does not like how I refer to its art! That’s a little sensitive for a billion floating-point numbers masquerading as a French man in a trench coat. 😛</p>

<p>…having an LLM chat running in a terminal session (optionally accepting pastes from another LLM or watching for instructions from special comments in your source tree) is a major shift in how we relate to writing code. … Working this way, it’s easy to get down a rabbit hole of machine-generated code and lose track of either the system changes or the feature you’re trying to build up. There’s plenty of room for UX improvement. But, it’s an intriguing preview of how we might build software in the future.</p>

			 <p>Of all the hype I’ve read about AI, <em>none</em> of it has suggested that they will make estimating software projects a thing of the past. If they aren’t going to eat software estimates, I guess we’re going to have to strap in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The good news is:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Delivering software reduces the demand for estimates</strong>. The faster you can deliver software, the less you will need estimates.</li>
<li>Estimating software as a list of tasks scored by effort and variance conveys the most important information required for good-faith use of estimates.</li>
<li>Planning out a project by developing an estimate, rather than just hacking it out, is a way of developing software and enough of a creative effort that you might enjoy it more than sitting in meetings and updating budget spreadsheets.</li>
</ol>
<p>— <a href="https://buttondown.com/therealadam/archive/make-peace-with-estimates-and-get-good-at-system/">Make peace with estimates and get good at system design along the way</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I finished this newsletter and asked myself, “<a href="https://youtu.be/3-ZUDtaGf3I?si=kyFvRM_GNXz92FWo">Do I <em>like</em> estimates now?</a>” I may not like them deeply in my bones, but I definitely changed my mind about them! In particular, looking at estimates as part of the creative process of designing, building, and delivering software is a useful perspective shift.</p>
<p>Back to the implied hype-question, “Will LLMs eat software estimation?”, I think the answer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines">no</a>. Language models can’t really generate new ideas or information. Even when <a href="https://therealadam.com/2025/03/06/vibe-coding-is-generating-code.html">vibe coding</a>, language models are reassembling existing ideas (e.g., their training data) in somewhat novel ways. They don’t generate new <em>information</em>, particularly in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">Claude Shannon</a> sense of the term.</p>
<p>Even if LLMs could generate novel information, estimates are painful when they create schedule risk (i.e., hard deadlines) rather than discover uncertainties and hedge against surprises. Language models can’t slop their way out of social, human problems.</p>

			 <p>I’ve noticed an uptick in writing about human thought processes using the language of machine learning and neural networks. Jargon-y phrases like “improve your mental search space” or “if at first you don’t succeed, improve your gradient descent”. (I only made up one of these sentences!)</p>
<p>Normally, I’m all about this kind of metaphorical bridge from one domain to another. But in a lot of these cases, I feel like more direct language would benefit both the discourse on language models <em>and</em> using them to approximate human intelligence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people who make LLMs have little discernible interest in cognition itself. Some of them may <em>believe</em> that they’re interested in cognition, but what they’re really focused on is <strong>product</strong> — that is, output, what gets spat out in words or images or sounds at the conclusion of an episode of thinking.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>While it’s spectacular that science has found success in modeling human intelligence with matrix multiplication, I think the humans engaged in science would benefit by avoidance of reducing human thought (intelligence, emotion, art, the whole gamut) down to GPU-friendly arithmetic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of critics think I’m stupid because my sentences are so simple and my method is so direct: they think these are defects. No. The point is to write as much as you know as quickly as possible.</p>

			 <p>If a team identifies a process, feature, or subsystem as “slow”, it risks resisting change by mythology alone.</p>

<p>Slowness seems to make a special contribution to this picture in our heads. Time is especially valuable. So as we learn that a task is slow, an especial cost accrues to it. Whenever we think of doing the task again, we see how expensive it is, and bail.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The show doesn’t go on because it’s ready; it goes on because it’s eleven-thirty.</p>
<p>— Lorne Michaels</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Saturday Night Live</em>, what fantastic hack! 😉 If you’re playing along at home, SNL is actually <em>two</em> deadline hacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a Big Consequences deadline at 11:30pm on Saturday; the show goes on whether a prop, sketch, or actor is ready or not.</li>
<li>Every live show week has a long-established cadence: pitching the host on Monday, writing through the night on Tuesday, table read on Wednesday, rehearsals and iteration Thursday and Friday, dress rehearsal on Saturday, final changes, and <em>then</em> the live show.</li>

			 <p>I should worry less about missing One Amazing Thing, the feed FOMO. I can’t read the whole internet. Not even the small part I’ve carefully selected and loaded into my feed reader.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsblur.com">Newsblur</a> has an option to expire feed items after some number of days. I’d previously disabled this, erroneously thinking I could at least read the part of the internet I have manually identified as interesting.</p>
<p>So, with some hesitation, I turned on expiring items, taking me from several thousand unread items to several hundred. This is a nice, but superficial, step forward. As a result, I’m reading feeds more frequently because there’s a less-scary top-line number. (Even when I had the number hidden, it was still scary.)</p>
<p>The good stuff, even if automatically expired, will <em>probably</em> find its way back to me. I’m likely to return to writers I enjoy and look through the archives anyway. Instead of feed FOMO, I should worry more about reading the bigger, guaranteed good things. There are books, essays, longer articles out there. Not to mention making my own stuff. Do more of that!</p>
<p>I wonder what other kinds of data would be improved with an expiration date. Not that <em>all</em> <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/10/30/make-it-ephemeral/">data should disappear</a>. Backlog/task-shaped data seems the most likely to benefit from automatically deleting themselves. Unread emails, tasks, project work, read-it-later links, watch-list videos, that one season you never got around to watching on a streaming service you’re <em>still</em> paying for. If those archived themselves, or I archived them every few months, maybe that would make for checking off more of the good stuff!</p>

			 <p>📺 Currently watching:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Paradise</em> (S1): James Marsden and Sterling K. Brown make an excellent cast. The show itself is an okay puzzle box/mystery story. Interestingly, not the deepest or best at building a mysterious world, so they may be able to land the second season without falling off.</li>
<li><em>Drive to Survive</em> (S7): this season was gifted with equal parts on-track competition and behind-the-scenes backstabbing. The 2024 season was surprisingly competitive. Nearly half of the drivers were seeking new seats. This makes for good television! (Reminder: this is a “Real Housewives” style show, not a sports documentary.🤣)</li>
<li><em>Severance</em> (S2): they still got it. Splendid cast, writing, production.</li>
<li><em>White Lotus</em> (S3): they also still got it. Another great cast of actors you know, some actors you don’t. Great scenery! Reminder: if you ever see show-creator Mike White on your vacation, probably move away so you don’t end up a character on the next season.</li>
<li><em>Andor</em> (S1): rewatching this anticipating Season 2. Definitely the best Star Wars of the Disney+ era, even though it’s not strictly the most entertaining one.</li>
<li><em>Slow Horses</em> (S1 &amp; S2): Gary Oldman as the leader of a band of misfits, outcast MI-5 spies? It works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shows returning later this year that I’m looking forward to: <em>Poker Face</em> S2, <em>Andor</em> S2, <em>Hacks</em> S4.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Having a method, a process, makes my writing more consistently good. This might sound like a win, but it is a problem. The usefulness and beauty of essays follow a power law, where the outliers create almost all the value—so if I make my essays more consistent, I remove not only the mistakes but also much of the upside.

			 <p>James Edward Gray II, <a href="https://programmersstone.blog/posts/scrappy-parsing/">Scrappy Parsing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The good news is that Elixir is the best language I have ever worked with for doing serious parsing. Let&rsquo;s prove it. Let&rsquo;s pull the data out of a SQLite database file using vanilla Elixir and some tricks from my Scrappy Programmer Livebook series.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reader: he proves it. I enjoyed the heck out of reading this. James has still got it. (One should never doubt that he might lose it!)</p>
<p>James’ code reminded me of the many ways Elixir is really lovely. I’ve annotated his code with my own reflections on what makes Elixir great. <strong>All the code is James’ work</strong>; the comments are my, well, commentary and opinions.</p>
<pre><code>  # First off, Elixir is lovely and I'm a little sad I've 
  # never had the opportunity to work with it on a daily 
  # basis.
  parse_page = fn bytes, i -&gt;
    start = if i == 1, do: 100, else: 0

    # Reading binary data via pattern matching is one of the
    # the best things about Erlang, so it's also a great thing 
    # about Elixir.
    &lt;&lt;raw_type::1*8,
      _first_page_freeblock::2*8,
      cell_count::2*8,
      _raw_cell_content_start::2*8,
      _fragmented_free_bytes::1*8,
      rest::binary&gt;&gt; = binary_slice(bytes, start, 12)

    # &quot;Plain old pattern matching&quot;, also lovely
    type =
      case raw_type do
        2 -&gt; :interior_index
        5 -&gt; :interior_table
        10 -&gt; :leaf_index
        13 -&gt; :leaf_table
      end

    right_most_pointer =
      if type in [:interior_index, :interior_table] do
        &lt;&lt;right_most_pointer::4*8&gt;&gt; = rest
        right_most_pointer
      else
        nil
      end

    %{
      index: i,
      start: start,
      type: type,
      cell_count: cell_count,
      right_most_pointer: right_most_pointer
    }
  end

  # Here we have a function defined for a very specific pattern match, including structural _and_ guard conditions. How many conditionals does this save in function bodies? I don't know how often this helps daily Elixir users, but I sure do love reading it.
  read_page = fn %{page_count: last_page} = db, i when i &gt; 0 and i &lt;= last_page -&gt;
    :file.position(db.file, (i - 1) * db.page_size)

    # Despite many attempts, Elixir's syntax design for function 
    # pipelines will probably always eclipse the same design in JavaScript or Ruby.
    # Spoiler: it's because Elixir doesn't have to rearrange `self` and the threaded parameter. 🤷🏻‍♂️
    db.file
    |&gt; IO.binread(db.page_size)
    |&gt; parse_page.(i)
  end

  # I've tripped all over myself praising Elixir here, but I'd
  # like to point out that Elixir has the same ungainly syntax
  # for calling anonymous functions that Ruby does. 😆
  open_db.(db_path, fn db -&gt;
    Enum.map(1..3//1, fn i -&gt;
      read_page.(db, i)
    end)
  end)

<p>Teams at the top of their game have a few things going for them. They operate with pace and confidence, reducing the need for time-consuming and detailed planning. They work together with coherence and trust, anticipating each other’s actions and decisions. This lets each individual on the team act with high agency to solve problems and act upon feedback quickly.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Our calendars are often painful because they display order (meetings) <em>too</em> well, but don’t display disorder (surprises and interruptions) at all.</p>
<p>Into every developer’s day (and managers in particular) arrives surprises, interruptions, questions, and side-quests. A bit of chaotic disorder.</p>
<p>Personally, in signing up for the job of engineering manager, I feel like I <em>also</em> signed up for the job of handling surprises and side-quests. I take them on not to protect my teams’ focus or time, but because surprises and questions are some of the best kind of information I can receive. They represent the friction points between my mental model of the organization or system and the details of the real world.</p>
<p>I would probably trade more interruptions and side quests for fewer recurring meetings!</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.instantdb.com/essays/sync_future">Sync Engines are the Future</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, what’s the significance of sync engines? I have a theory that every major technology shift happened when one part of the stack collapsed with another. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web apps collapsed cross-platform development. Instead of developing two or three versions of your app, you now develop one, available everywhere!</li>
<li>Node.js collapsed client and server development. You get one language instead of two! You can share code between them!</li>
<li>Docker collapsed the distinction between dev and prod.</li>
<li>React collapsed HTML and JS, Tailwind collapsed JS and CSS.</li>
</ul>
<p>So where does that leave sync engines? They collapse the database and the server. If your database is smart enough and capable enough, why would you even need a server? Hosted database saves you from the horrors of hosting and lets your data flow freely to the frontend.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Conceptual compression is a <em>big deal</em>. Even discounting for uneven distribution of technological shifts, like Docker dev environments and collapsing client/server, HTML, and CSS all into JS.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/garden-co/jazz">Sync</a> and <a href="https://automerge.org">local-first</a> <a href="https://github.com/aspen-cloud/triplit">storage</a> <a href="https://tinybase.org">engines</a> seem like they could be a big deal. It’s a tricky problem to solve. And, governments taking a turn for the weird lately, being able to move your data to another locality and point, with certainty at where data rests, is a useful ability!</li>

			 <p>Text boxes were not meant for collaboration.</p>
<p>How often do you find the majority of the coordination, collaboration, and team work you do happens by typing into (sometimes unsophisticated) text boxes and reading what other people typed into similar text boxes?</p>
<p>And now we’re increasingly typing in text boxes to interact with simulacra of human intelligence!</p>
<p>Emoji have helped — teamwork is easier if people opt into leaving hints about how they <em>feel</em> about something. Corollary: do not try to dead-pan in a text-only or high-latency video format. It will only end poorly.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure what to make of the humble text box’s crucial role in our society increasingly built on communication, knowledge, and using the two to generate more of the latter.</p>
<p>On one hand, before there were text boxes, writers have used various styli, pens, and typewriters to compose basically all of human culture and knowledge. So maybe the tool-in-hand (i.e., a text box) is not the crucial element.</p>
<p>On the other hand, given slightly more expressive tools, musicians have created the gamut of musical culture in only a few hundred years.</p>

<p>This goes about as well a human trying to implement the entire spec in one epic commit. At best, you get a big ball of illegible mud that looks right but doesn’t quite work. At worst, it’s riddled with syntax errors or misused APIs, aka “hallucinations”.</p>
<p>For better or worse, an LLM can slop out as much code as you are willing to pay for, but the compiler/runtime still has the last laugh.</p>

<p>The workflow includes: prompts for generating product requirements, technical specifications, project plans. It recommended tools for implementing those ideas into new and existing projects.

It’s not a “everything is shiny and free from surprising consequences” sort of piece.</p>
<p>As if you haven’t heard it enough lately: it is, earnestly, mind blowing that we can go from a few sentences describing an idea to a working prototype in a few hours of supervising an LLM. Inevitably, we’ll learn about shortcomings, scaling problems, and pitfalls in the coming years. As ever!

<ul>
<li>Morale is a byproduct of everything going on in the company. While improving it shouldn’t be an objective in itself, there are many reasons to pay attention to it.</li>
<li>Instead of focusing on mood or morale, gather qualitative feedback on specific topics. This is more actionable and precise, and should help you address actual issues and not the resulting low morale that is just a side effect.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Morale is a second order effect of the fundamentals that managers and leadership work on. If the outcomes, process, technology, teams, and people are aligned and thoughtfully cared for, good morale is <em>possible</em>. If one or more are misaligned, morale and motivation can suffer.</p>

			 <p>Consider two adventurers, one setting off alone and another setting off with fellow explorers. Both in search of greater glory through software development. 🙃</p>
<p>One adventurer closes social media, shifts into <a href="https://therealadam.com/2024/09/11/on-founder-mode.html">Founder mode</a>, and grinds out “wins” to the satisfaction of their benefactors. They move quickly, but sometimes diverge from their fellow explorers. When discarding a day’s work that solves the wrong problem is drama-free, they may have gone further than their fellow explorers.</p>
<p>Another adventurer has learned how endeavors succeed from experience and observation. The adventurer knows they will create something of intangible greatness by influencing a team of explorers. At times, the journey must pause. The team of explorers gathers to consider the map and decide how to proceed. These moments of collaboration and coordination are essential to the journey. The adventurer who only knows how to proceed alone will fall behind the adventurer who can rally a whole expedition crew. Thus, the adventurer does not directly produce the journey, but is essential nonetheless.</p>
<p>Thus, the team of explorers, when pulling together, goes much further than scrappy bands of individualistic explorers often pulling at odds with each other.</p>

<p>Update, a contender has entered the ring: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOyvYnkdEcc">Carole King performs “You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman”</a> pretty dang slowly. Which she wrote!</p>
<p>So I have to relax the iron rule here. That’s okay, I have another one.</p>
<p>New iron rule of Aretha Franklin: no one made ‘em sweat like Aretha. In part, because Aretha contractually insisted every room she played have the air conditioning turned off to protect her vocal cords.</p>
<p>About a <a href="https://www.furinsider.com/aretha-franklin-rest-in-soul-divas-we-love-series/"><em>VH-1 Divas</em> television performance</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As producers laid out the run of show and began rehearsals at the Beacon Theater an electrician called in to work on the air conditioning accidentally flipped a switch and cold air began blowing down on the stage. Now, it was widely known at the time that Ms. Franklin had a clause in her contract that there was to be no AC during her performances and rehearsals as the cold air agitated her vocal chords and prevented her from giving her best performance. It wasn’t a matter of being high-maintenance; it was her professional commitment to giving her audience her best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next time you’re watching a live performance, look at how much Aretha, and everyone else in the room, is sweating. It’s not just the stage lights. She’s the queen for a reason!</p>

			 <p>You’re deep in eldritch code, a product problem, or a cross-functional issue that is affecting your team. Hours have passed, and you feel like you’re only starting to get your bearings with the issue. Finding a solution, let alone considering its consequences, seems further hours away.</p>
<p>You’re down a rabbit hole. You need to explore a very open-ended concern, but you also need to maintain a bias toward action.</p>
<p>Don’t go without a time box or teammate. Set a time limit. Or, ask a colleague to keep you accountable. You want a constraining mechanism to pull you out of the hole if you get lost.</p>
<p>“Rubber duck” the issue before you start. Explain it out loud or write a summary in your notes. You may activate a different part of your brain and talk yourself out of the rabbit hole entirely.</p>
<p>Keep notes. Track every conceptual tunnel you explore. Note the dead-ends and red herrings. Show something for your effort, even if you don’t find what you were looking for.</p>
<p>Tell teammates what the rabbit hole is and why you think it’s necessary. Ideally, you can explain this in a sentence or two at most. Think about how long you think it’s worthwhile to go down that rabbit hole. Don’t spend more than that in the rabbit hole!</p>
<p>When you encounter black boxes, rabbit holes in rabbit holes, note them and keep moving. You’re already distracted by this rabbit hole, don’t get distracted from your distraction! Not all rabbit holes are worth exploring – some lead to deeper problems without payoff.</p>

			 <p>You never stop growing as a project leader.</p>
<p><a href="https://therealadam.com/2024/07/30/hurry-up-and.html">Hurry up and flub your first fifty projects</a>; the sooner you learn from stumbling, the better. Get a <em>taste</em> for all the technical and interpersonal ways a thing can go sideways. Grow past trying to use process to block all the ways projects have punched you in the face. Develop your sense for a project that is drifting off the golden path. Experiment with and develop your moves for bringing the project back.</p>
<p>Accept that people will always ask for estimates. Find peace in a way to provide them honestly. Help your team use estimates as planning and research without feeling like they’re setting themselves up for failure.</p>
<p>Most importantly, give your team the freedom to solve meaningful problems instead of grinding through a backlog of tasks and epics.</p>

			 <p>Perfection often manifests as procrastination. But, we imagine our work with more perfection and grandeur than we could hope to achieve in reality. By definition!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something—our limited talents, our limited time, our limited control over events, and over the actions of other people—will always render our creation less than perfect. Dispiriting as this might sound at first, it contains a liberating message: if you’re procrastinating on something because you’re worried you won’t do a good enough job, you can relax—because judged by the flawless standards of your imagination, you definitely won’t do a good enough job. So you might as well make a start.</p>
<p>— Oliver Burkeman, <em>Four Thousand Weeks</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Better to get a bit done today, no matter how small or imperfect. Over the days and weeks, what’s done will compound. That compounding effort yields a better idea of how to realize what you imagined, and opportunities to reach for the perfection or grandeur originally imagined. 📈</p>

			 <p>Don’t sweat the network or medium.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s all tinkering at the margins! Serving at the pleasure of the algorithm! The core concern, the thing that really matters, is doing interesting things. You can literally forget about everything beyond that. Interesting can mean whatever you want!</p>
<p>— Aaron Francis, <a href="https://aaronfrancis.com/2024/reputation-is-portable-b41ee8ac">Reputation is portable</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could clip the whole article! 👏🏻</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Networks come and go. Platforms come and go. Followers come and go.</p>
<p>Your reputation is portable. You take it with you wherever you go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This works because the particular networks don’t matter (much) in the end. It’s the people! If a network has reached critical mass, and your people or scene are there, then you don’t need to think much about anything else. How you post to a particular network, or how popular you are on any given network, matters less than participating in the network at all.</p>
<p>What matters is doing and sharing the work. Finding the network with <a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/">your people or scene</a>. Telling people about your work. Supporting the work of others on the scene.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you focus on the core, the craft, you&rsquo;re free from the algorithms. Good tweet flopped? No worries, I&rsquo;ve got plenty more. Bad tweet succeeded? Awesome, I&rsquo;ve got plenty more. Keep doing things, keep hitting the publish button. By all means learn from your successes and failures. Adjust your strategy to meet your goals. But remember, you can afford to play the slow game. Building something durable takes a long time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s tough to play the long game lately. In particular, because social networks (and news media) are primed to tell us the short game is everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should my favorite social platform collapse tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll take my reputation with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Granted, these networks can boost us in pretty amazing ways. But, we exist largely outside of them. At the end of the day, we are what we’ve done and who we’ve helped along the way. These networks aren’t built to track our value as people, so don’t sweat it.</p>

<p>Once you stop believing that it might somehow be possible to avoid hard choices about time, it gets easier to make better ones. You begin to grasp that when there’s too much to do, and there always will be, the only route to psychological freedom is to let go of the limit-denying fantasy of getting it all done and instead to focus on doing a few things that count.</p>

			 <p>In short: like any method of working that is copied from one organization and pasted into another, very different organization, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders">chutes and ladders</a>. Habits and practices that will help you move faster or skip ahead outright. Anti-patterns and missteps that will set you back days and weeks.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/151691/2025/4e7c9d5000.png" alt="The game board for chutes and ladders"></p>
<p>Herein, some things I learned whilst using <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a> over the course of a few years across teams of varied experience and specializations.</p>
<h2 id="how-teams-succeed-at-shape-up">How teams succeed at Shape Up</h2>
<p>Three practices that might help your first Shape Up projects:</p>
<p><strong>The Model-T button</strong>. The first slice of your solution is crucial to success at Shape Up. I found that the more that slice was constrained, the better. I often tried to pitch the first working demo as “just a button that does the thing; you can have any button, as long as it’s black”. No ornamentation, no workflow, no layering, only a button that solves the pitched problem end-to-end without any “magic behind the curtain”. When the team quickly arrives at this milestone, it opens up the rest of their time to iterate on everything else that makes a suitable solution. And, they can do so with confidence that the big question of “can we solve this?” is already answered.</p>
<p><strong>Coherent jargon leads to the good team-think</strong>. It warms my heart, a big moment of pride, when teams start using language as a tool for thinking about their project at a higher level. Even if the jargon is a little silly or requires explanation to an outsider. When teams wield conceptual compression to make sure they’re aligned on the specifics of the problem and how they’re solving it, I’m pretty sure they’re going to succeed at delivering the pitch. Even if the underlying problem or solution spaces are complicated!</p>
<p><strong>Save some margin</strong> for finishing, details, socialization, delivering, etc. The most successful projects I saw left time at the end of the iteration to finish. I often called it “pencils down” time. In part, this was a breather and a milestone to let the team know they were done with the development part. It also lets them mentally shift into the mindset required for QA, fixing details, finding bugs, writing documentation, preparing release checklists, sharing changes with colleagues outside the product team, etc.</p>
<h2 id="rakes-ive-stepped-on-whilst-shaping-up">Rakes I’ve stepped on whilst Shaping Up</h2>
<p>Three (bad) habits that could stymy your first Shape Up project:</p>
<p><strong>Aligning work based on individual specialization.</strong> If all your tasks have “front-end” and “back-end” labels, you might end up with something you can’t quickly demo, iterate, and release. Related, if the first slice of your project doesn’t show an end-to-end solution, you don’t actually have your first slice. Lesson: you may need to work together more intensely, and decompose the work differently, than you do with processes that regard the work as simple queues.</p>
<p><strong>Pitches and product docs so deep, you can’t see the ending from the beginning.</strong> You may need to split it up. Shape Up is, in many ways, about splitting work up more sensibly. But, if your pitch doesn’t work as independent components/solutions, you’ve got a problem! The good news is, splitting up a pitch into tasks is very similar to splitting a pitch into multiple pitches; it’s all about chasing down the dependencies, minimizing them, and thinking about how to build off existing work. Splitting up a too-large pitch is potentially a good way to practice at an essential activity of Shape Up without committing to a particular project just yet.</p>
<p><strong>Pressing on with a wobbly project.</strong> Path dependence is tough. If you aren’t willing to use the Circuit Breaker on your first few projects, it becomes increasingly difficult to do so later. Without the ability to cut loose from a project that isn’t going to expectations, you’ll have lost the ability to do fixed time <em>and</em> scope. That’s (probably) why you looked into Shape Up in the first place. I find it important to keep in mind that Shape Up is, in part, about working with hypotheticals and options. It’s often better to stop a project that isn’t going well and move on to the next (most likely) equally promising, project.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have a lot more to say about Shape Up! But, I like putting shorter, punchier bits out, so here we are. Please let me know what you’d like to hear more about!</p>

			 <p><em>What We Do in the Shadows</em>, final season + finale: they did a fantastic job on the finale. The last season had a few stand-out episodes; it doesn’t feel like the show went one season too long. Favorites: “Sleep Hypnosis”, “The Railroad”, “Lazlo’s Father”.</p>
<p><em>Sticky</em>: I wanted to like this because Margo Martindale is a delight. And, it was only six (short) episodes, so I thought it was going to be an easy, one-and-done watch. The finale left me thinking they intend to bring more material. But the world is flat and clearly wants to be <em>Fargo</em>, but a bit further north.</p>
<p>I would have found it “just okay” if they’d managed to get in and out with three hours of material. As it is, it seems like another season is intended, which leaves me feeling meh and not sure if Amazon will even pick this up to close out the narrative. On the upside for the creators and cast, at least Amazon seems most willing to let shows run long than other streaming studios.</p>
<p><em>Skeleton Crew</em>: the adventure is good, the cast of kids is fun, the surrounding world is great. I wouldn’t have thought <em>Goonies</em> or <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>, but Star Wars, would work, but it’s hitting the mark.</p>
<p><em>For All Mankind</em>: we’re rewatching parts of this ahead of the forthcoming season. I’m reminded that the first season in particular is a real dinger. And half of the dramatic tension in the show is generated by the foolish actions of one particularly space-faring family.</p>

			 <p>There are many ways to feel like you’re living out the same workday over and over. Weekly, if you’re unlucky. Let’s talk about two in particular: failure to write it down, and failure to decide (on how to decide).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Write down the ways you didn&rsquo;t choose, for God&rsquo;s sake. Because otherwise you&rsquo;re gonna run into… every approach has a problem and as soon as somebody runs into the problem they&rsquo;re gonna say &ldquo;oh, why didn&rsquo;t we do it the other way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you write down why you didn&rsquo;t do it the other way they&rsquo;ll look at it and be like &ldquo;oh, right, right. Yeah, it sounded worse the other way&rdquo; and they can move on. Otherwise the same conversation happens again.</p>
<p>— Kevin Ball and Kristján Pétursson, <a href="https://www.humanskills.co/p/human-skills-018-creating-clarity">Creating Clarity From Ambiguity</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides the general-purpose wisdom of “write it down”, this specific scenario hits home. Having to re-litigate a team’s decision every time a curveball comes along is both exhausting and a morale killer. Been there, would like to avoid that.</p>
<p>The alternatives-not-taken don’t need detailed write-ups. It works well enough to enumerate them, briefly describe the idea, and highlight the shortcomings or reasons that decision wasn’t taken.</p>
<hr>
<p>Storytime: the last team I worked on that used MySQL had the “why didn’t we do it the other way?” problem <em>every time</em> a new developer was onboarded.</p>
<p>This was in the mid-2010s, when PostgreSQL and MySQL were reaching feature parity as single-host databases. PostgreSQL replication was <em>just</em> good enough to use in production. Further, it was several years into Heroku running PostgreSQL as a default, so <em>many</em> Rails developers had either not used MySQL or were unsure why one would choose MySQL.</p>
<p>Sometime in their first week, countless developers would ask or suggest some variation on “why don’t we use/why aren’t we moving to PostgreSQL?”. And every time, a bespoke reason was given, usually by a somewhat overworked/cranky person from the ops team. It typically rhymed with “this was the Rails default when we first built the app” or “migrating a database is an enormous effort with many second-order consequences and next-to-zero customer benefit, so here we are”.</p>
<p>If we had instead taken the time to document this in the onboarding material? Priceless, and one fewer interactions with cranky ops folks!</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>More talking. More translating. Action items are assigned, which gives everyone the illusion that progress was made. And we all return to our respective regional offices and wait until we have the same meeting again, where we attempt to communicate intelligently with each other. But all we really do is schedule meetings… when what we need to do is figure out who makes decisions.</p>
<p>— Rands in Repose, <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/bits-features-and-truth/">Bits, Features, and Truth</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same story, different tune. If a group (of leaders) can’t decide how to operate, collaboratively think, and make decisions, they’re doomed to repeat the same conversations and action items.</p>
<p>In my experience in this kind of ongoing and repetitive meeting, the root problem is failing to decide. Deciding how to decide is an important decision to make! If you come into a meeting not knowing how you’re going to get out of the meeting with closure, the meetings will just compound. It’s like interest-only payments at the beginning of your mortgage, slightly demoralizing but absolutely required per the (very) long-term contract you’ve signed.</p>
<hr>
<p>My kingdom for software that makes it easier to collaborate, think, and decide than it is to schedule ​<em>one more meeting</em>​. 🙄</p>

			 <p>It was a good year of reading, for me. I read some big books. I got more insight out of the books I read. Furthermore, I read things I don’t normally read, like philosophy and books about octopuses that help some troubled folks find their way in life.</p>
<p>A few things worked well for me, so here I am sharing them.</p>
<h2 id="bring-a-computer-assistant">Bring a (computer) assistant</h2>
<p><a href="https://therealadam.com/2024/12/26/reading-with-a-computer-assistant.html">I used ChatGPT and Claude to ask questions about tricky passages in non-fiction and philosophy books</a>. This kept me “in the text” more. I was less distracted by wondering what some term meant or the context of a historical reference. LLMs are great for asking questions about or summarizing passages, expanding upon interesting ideas, and getting historical context.</p>
<p>The “world knowledge” trained into these contemporary LLMs is sufficient to answer most questions without the need to provide extra context. I haven’t found the need to fiddle with trying to load the text of books I’m reading into an LLM to get it to answer coherently.</p>
<p>As ever, trust but verify anything a computer masquerading as a human tells you.</p>
<h2 id="read-actively">Read actively</h2>
<p>Laid back on the couch, propped up on a comfy pillow, bathed in natural light (not-too-bright, not-too-gloomy), and just the right temperature. This <em>sounds</em> like the portrait of an ideal reading situation.</p>
<p>But, I’ve found that reading challenging books, and getting more out of them, requires a more upright and active posture. Holding the book open on at a desk with one hand with a pen or highlighter at the ready in another is the ideal for challenging books. Hands-on, it’s important.</p>
<p>Highlighting, summarizing, annotating, and commenting on interesting passages keeps my mind in the game for longer. I’m more likely to return to the ideas and get something out of them. I often combine this with my 🤖assistant to summarize dense passages, ask questions about something I think I’m missing, or to expand on words/ideas I don’t already know.</p>
<h2 id="always-be-choosing-good-books">Always Be Choosing (Good Books)</h2>
<p>It does no good to read better if I’m reading things that I don’t enjoy or learn from.</p>
<p>I regularly parallelize my reading across a few genres, at least fiction and non-fiction. At times, comics, philosophy, or technical books. At other times, I’ve tried to cluster a few books in the same topical area and enjoyed it. Fiction is the least parallelizable genre, in my experience. It’s tricky to keep multiple fictional storylines/characters in my head, in the same way that holding the button mappings for multiple games in my head is tricky.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed doing <a href="https://jaredhenderson.substack.com">Commonplace Philosophy</a> read-alongs. I’m getting a lot of out of the Arendt read-along (a <em>very</em> challenging text, for me), the Aristotle <em>Ethics</em> one was insightful, and I’m really looking forward to the one on <em>The Dispossessed</em>. So, “philosophical sci-fi” will probably figure highly in my 2025 reading choices.</p>
<p><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/08/reading-and-rabbit-holes.html">Clustering around a topic</a>, another idea I picked up from Tyler Cowen, is fun when I find a few books stacked up around a topic. That said, given I choose to read tome-like non-fiction in particular, having three non-fiction books in progress at one time is not often workable.</p>
<p>The flip-side of selecting good material is changing my mind. I’m still learning to stop when the material isn’t meeting my expectations. Not only should I <a href="https://therealadam.com/2024/10/21/throw-more-books.html">throw more books</a>, I should consider aggressively skimming/summarizing-via-assistant/copilot when books turn out to be too thin or simply not the right thing.</p>
<h2 id="you-still-cant-beat-a-dumb-old-kindle">You (still) can’t beat a dumb-old Kindle</h2>
<p>Reading on a Kindle is more pleasant than an iPad.</p>
<p>Despite better functionality on iPad for active reading, it’s way easier to read on a Kindle device. It’s partly down to size and partly down to <em>lack</em> of functionality, as ever.</p>
<p>You can’t underestimate the benefit of reading speed and the difficulty of distracting yourself when reading on a Kindle. 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>That said, the Kindle app on tablets does have a few things going for it, and I hope someday these things will come to a reasonably distraction-free Kindle device, someday:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Read it to me”, not audiobooks, just plain old text-to-speech voices, makes some kinds of reading easier to sustain because there’s a voice to focus on and keep up with.</li>
<li>Adding notes and connecting dots to highlights becomes a “secondary session” activity when reading on Kindle alone. Ideally, that kind of entry is easier on a Kindle device. I didn’t realize there was magic in the iOS keyboard implementation until I tried to type quickly on a simplistic Kindle. Whatever Apple has implemented there, Amazon should pick up on it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-wishlist-for-2025">A wishlist for 2025</h2>
<p>My kingdom for short, dense non-fiction instead of short non-fiction that is merely a longer magazine article restated several times.</p>
<p>Comic-style “primers” on deep topics like Sartre and chaos theory are my favorite way to start on big ideas. I hope more complicated topics and wicked problems will get this treatment in 2025, and that I’ll discover said primers.</p>
<p>I’d definitely kick the tires on an interesting, slightly better integrated way to read long-form, i.e., books with an LLM-powered assistant at-hand. The bar is low here; I’m copying and pasting between apps to make this work right now.</p>
<p>Maybe Amazon, Remarkable, Boox, or even Apple will make the reader/hardware situation more exciting in 2025!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I wanted to tinker with <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/"><code>llm</code></a> and “AI engineer” up a humble tool for working with my notes, writings, highlights, etc. Emphasis on humble: if I could tinker with any one of those datasets quickly and iteratively, I would mark it as a win. (Previously, <a href="https://therealadam.com/2024/10/31/scaling-down-native.html">Scaling down native dev</a>.) Medium story short, I exported some of my reading highlights, loaded it into a database, and wrapped a quick UI around it to navigate my highlights via embeddings rather than keyword search. A few short sessions later, maybe a few hours total, I had something interesting working. 💪🏻</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="1-data">1. Data</h2>
<p>For several years, I’ve used <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a> to capture highlights and search/review them later. Handily, Readwise has CSV (and tree-of-Markdown files) exports of all one’s highlights. As data formats go, CSV is nearly perfect for this exercise. It’s structured, so parsing is not required to shoehorn it into a low-ceremony data pipeline. That said, Readwise’s export isn’t perfect: notably it lacks URLs the highlights started with. But for experiments, it’s a start.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/151691/2024/cleanshot-2024-12-16-at-10.44.21.png" alt="Readwise highlights in a Numbers spreadsheet"></p>
<h2 id="2-pipeline">2. Pipeline</h2>
<p>Thanks to <code>sqlite-utils</code>, I can generate a SQLite database from the export CSV. This all happens by convention with the <code>sqlite-utils</code> command line.</p>
<pre><code>db:
    sqlite-utils insert \
      highlights.db \
      highlights \
      data/readwise-data-2.csv \
      --csv \
      --pk id
</code></pre>
<p>No bespoke (Python) code is required in this whole pipeline process. I ended up <a href="https://github.com/therealadam/highlights-embedding-prototype/blob/main/justfile">encapsulating</a> the steps in a <code>Justfile</code>, but anything that can run shell commands would have done the trick.</p>
<p>Step two is to generate embeddings. With the right install, this is another one-liner, this time with <code>llm</code>. We query the database generated in the previous step to give us content to pass through to a text embedding model. The generated vectors are stored into the same SQLite database.</p>
<pre><code>embed:
    llm embed-multi \
      docs \
      --database highlights.db \
      --store \
      --sql 'select id, highlights.&quot;Book Title&quot; as title, highlights.&quot;Highlight&quot; as content from highlights' \
      --model mpnet
</code></pre>
<p>There is no step three! The data is ready to query for “semantic”, not keyword, similarity search. To prove to myself I had an end-to-end working proof of concept, I used this snippet to query the data:</p>
<pre><code># $ just query &quot;now is not the time for notes&quot;
query q:
    llm similar \
      docs \
      --database highlights.db \
      --content '{{q}}'
</code></pre>
<h2 id="3-prototype">3. Prototype</h2>
<p>Next, I put it all together in a <a href="https://github.com/therealadam/highlights-embedding-prototype/blob/main/app.py">FastHTML app</a>. This was fun! FastHTML is great for this kind of bespoke, informal hacking. Caveat, some of this may not be idiomatic Python. I’m just coming back to Python after not having written it in seriousness for twenty years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the <code>dataclass</code> decorator on a class and a method for converting an object to a “FastTag”, love this for low-ceremony <em>but typed</em> data modeling.</li>
<li>I finally got the grasp of Python’s generator syntax. I want to like <code>itertools</code>, but it’s a pain to use. (🌶️ Ruby’s <code>Enumerable</code> remains undefeated.)</li>
<li>JSX-like syntax to structure UI in code is great. This approach falls down <em>every time</em> I put a designer in front of an editor, but I’m going to call it: this is the mark-up/UI-construction ergonomics developers crave.</li>
<li>There’s no need for a layered web-app approach here. There’s a <code>similar</code> function that turns query text into similar highlight “model” objects. That’s a nice affordance for working quickly and loosely.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Python’s has pleasant things going on lately. Even a career Ruby developer like myself can find kind things to say. 😉</p>
<p>The trickiest part to building with LLMs and generative AI is source data. Prompting a model as-is is not much more interesting than using ChatGPT or Claude. Ergo: look to one’s notes, posts, highlights, etc. to find compelling data to build upon.</p>
<p>Variations on RAG (this is probably a bit short of calling itself RAG, but it’s <em>very</em> close) produce more appealing results than keyword indexing, but not by much. I don’t think it’s the center of a product yet; more of a sidebar or enhancement.</p>
<p>All of this took less than five hours to build. I’ll probably end up spending a couple of hours total writing it up. This is the kind of “working with the garage door up” kind of thing I want to do. 💯📈</p>

<p>It remains very true that all <a href="https://therealadam.com/2023/11/25/zawinskis-law-updated.html">software expands to the point that it can host checklists</a>. I try not to worry too much when a task list emerges from a note. If I can keep that task list short-lived, i.e., finish it within a working session, it’s not a problem.</p>
<p>I continue to wish Things would do their very well-considered thing and make notes a first-class concept in their app. But only if they can solve it with their consistently high quality of thoughtfulness and execution. Until then, I’m thrilled with them not bolting it on at all.</p>
<p>Lately, I’m choosing my apps for simplicity of general-purpose use. Customization and scriptability are great on paper. But then I fiddle too much instead of getting stuff done.</p>
<p>That said, I have three different notes-shaped apps in my daily workflow. I’m basically fine with this! Maybe I’m done with all-knowing, open-ended, monolithic apps for Managing All the Work. 🤞</p>

<p>Can’t live with ‘em, can’t live without ‘em🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>A product team (at least the ones that have been working for more than three weeks) has a backlog of work they’d love to tackle, but now’s not the right time. Maybe it’s not the most important, a practical solution isn’t in-hand, the technology isn’t ready yet, or a dependency hasn’t started work yet. Either way: a growing, somewhat discouraging list of things they <em>want</em> to do but can’t <em>yet</em>.</p>
<p>Over time, a backlog evolves to many forms. None of them are ideal. We have to look at backlogs for what they are: an artifact of <a href="https://therealadam.com/2024/11/27/im-reading-four.html">time’s finite-ness and our finite ability to do work</a> in the present.</p>
<p>A “big pile of sadness backlog” doesn’t acknowledge limitations in time and capacity. It imagines a future where we can do <em>everything</em> we’ve ever wanted. The backlog actually gets shorter. All those problems we once wanted to solve, we can. We are also a bit taller, more attractive, and feel a bit younger while we’re at it.</p>
<p>But that day never comes, and we’re left with a sad backlog of things. <em>Almost</em> (and this is the nefarious part) all of them less important than what we’re currently doing, but still, we think, important. So it stares at us from the shadows, a bit sad and discouraging us that we are failing at our job by having this large backlog of ideas and promising projects. At least we think they’re promising! More likely, in my experience, attempting to triage the pile of sadness backlog yield two more meta-projects around organizing the sadness to highlight the truly sad from the merely unfortunate. 😮‍💨</p>
<p>It’s more helpful to look at a backlog as numerous maybe-good ideas sent to our future-selves. By definition, a backlog is speculation. We <em>thought</em> executing on these projects and tasks would improve things, but we won’t <em>know</em> until we do. Schrödinger&rsquo;s cat and all that. Storing all that speculation away in a pile is healthy. If it turns out one of these ideas is the right starting point for the next most important problem we face, we’ll pull it out of the backlog and give it a think. Otherwise, it stays there, putting no current work at risk.</p>
<p>The contents of a backlog are frozen in time. The tasks, projects, docs, designs, screenshots, diagrams, etc. all reflect a point in time. Some call this rot, implying “hey, we should have been better about keeping this campsite clean and used our (infinite 😜) time to tend it”. IMO that’s not the best approach; better to regard aging tasks as issues and solutions from a point of time. They may no longer reflect the circumstances the product and team currently face. Items in a backlog necessarily need updating by a PM or developer to figure out if they still make sense, would solve the problem, or are a direct solution to that problem.</p>
<p>I have quite the extended personal backlog of items to read and project ideas. When I regard them as missed opportunities, as evidence that I could have been at least a little more diligent in managing my time, it’s stressful and discouraging. When I instead regard it as a pile of ideas in reserve for mornings I wake up and none of my current hobby projects are enticing or what I’m reading isn’t doing it for me, then those backlogs are useful. Granted, said lists aren’t getting much shorter.</p>
<p>Perhaps, a backlog is a defense mechanism. They are, at times, a way to deliver a soft no, to ourselves or collaborators. “Not a bad idea, but not something we can get to right away. It’s in the backlog. Maybe someday we’ll come upon it.”</p>
<p>Or, you may have an impeccable backlog! All killer, no filler; like a “no-skips” album, but in product backlog form. If you’re out there, please let us know how you got here and how much effort it takes. 😆 (Really, if you’re out there, I’m intrigued!)</p>
<p>The flip side is no backlog at all. The project work is a river and if something interesting floats past, you seize upon it. Otherwise, you let it float downstream and don’t worry about it too much. Or, there’s no team backlog, but the team members keep a list of ideas/task/projects that might be interesting in the future and bring them up at opportune moments. That works too!</p>

<p>Instead, see if you can scratch whatever hands-on building/coding/designing itch you have in your time. You’ll necessarily have to scale it down. Honestly, that’s a great constraint!

			 <p>A couple of lessons on leadership in ​Herbert’s <em>Dune</em>​:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Give as few orders as possible,” his father had told him…once…long ago. “Once you’ve given orders on a subject, you must always give orders on that subject.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Avoid, whenever possible, making decisions <em>for</em> people and teams. It may end up discouraging or preventing them from making <em>any</em> decisions for themselves in the future.</p>
<p>Frequent top-down decisions are the autonomy-killer, they might say. 🤓</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hawat arose, glancing around the room as though seeking support. He turned away, led the procession out of the room. The others moved hurriedly, scraping their chairs on the floor, balling up in little knots of confusion. It ended up in confusion, Paul thought, staring at the backs of the last men to leave. Always before, Staff had ended on an incisive air. This meeting had just seemed to trickle out, worn down by its own inadequacies, and with an argument to top it off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what bad meetings feel like; they deflate like a balloon. Worse than indecision, they bring confusion about how to proceed, where efforts really stand, or if the current approach is the right approach. Not necessarily because of debate or disagreement. But, the lack of consensus or direction certainly doesn’t help.</p>

			 <p>Reader, I want to (<a href="https://therealadam.com/2021/01/10/the-unreasonable-effectiveness.html">once again</a>) talk to you about the life-changing power of making a list and putting it in order.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ambiguity of like, &ldquo;what are we gonna build?&rdquo; or &ldquo;how are we supposed to build this?&rdquo; Or was it supposed to be A or B or why did we make this decision? So having the checklist of &ldquo;this is the thing,&rdquo; it is a very, very cheap way to eliminate most of the ambiguity.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Tasks lists are great for capturing and organizing what you want/need to do. They are sometimes good for thinking through how to execute on those tasks and projects.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ordinarily, I’m too focused on all those incomplete items The empty check boxes, the lines that aren’t crossed through. So much potential. It’s exciting <em>and</em> overwhelming!</p>
<p>I rarely use my task list to reflect upon what I’ve <em>done</em>. To retrospect on how much I accomplished any given day or capture a post-hoc note or two on follow-ups, what worked, or to merely pat myself on the back for a day of honest work.</p>
<p>So I’m trying this right now! But, applications could stand to add more affordances for looking <em>back</em> in time too. This goes for applications like Things as much as it goes for Jira, etc. It’s probably our work and hustle culture. 🤷‍♂️ Always looking forward and rarely slowing down to say “hey, I did this, let’s get excited about that!”</p>
<p>One of the nice things about Kanban boards is you eventually end up with a giant pile of things that were done, and that’s a nice way to feel the momentum building that a bunch of stuff got done. Let’s get more of that.</p>

			 <p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s number</a> is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships—relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person”.</p>
<p>Corollary: any group size approaching 150 people (Dunbar’s number) includes at least one person who knows about Dunbar’s number.</p>
<p>To paraphrase a classic joke, “How do you know if someone knows about Dunbar’s number? They’ll tell you!” I’m telling you, right now, I know about Dunbar’s number. 🙃</p>
<p>Practically, I think this implies:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re designing an organization <em>close to</em> but not <em>exceeding</em> Dunbar’s number, you can hand-wave the details of when it grows to exceed Dunbar’s number. Someone will enthusiastically let you know that the organization has exceeded Dunbar’s number and might need reconsideration. 🥸</li>
<li>For organizations as small as 10% of Dunbar’s number (15), there’s a pretty dang good chance that someone knows about Dunbar’s number. For organizations any multiple of that size, you don’t need to go around telling everyone about Dunbar’s number. Chance are, someone is telling everyone about Dunbar’s number. 😆</li>
</ul>
<p>My experience in (software) teams is there are breakpoints far smaller than Dunbar’s number that matter even more.</p>

			 <p>Permit me to throw shade at the Emmy Awards for a moment.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Reservation Dogs</em> is a better kinda-comedy than <em>The Bear</em>. <em>Dogs</em> is consistently funny <em>and</em> finds ways to explore the lives, relationships, and histories of the characters in rewarding ways.</p>
<p><em>The Bear</em> is equal parts endearing and yelling. Once or twice a season, it speaks to craft and intensity. Those are my favorite episodes. The Fak family is the only undeniably comedic element of <em>The Bear</em>. Give us a spin-off of <em>that</em> and let it legitimately win all comedy awards.</p>
<p><em>The Bear</em> belongs in the drama category, but isn’t the length of a drama because no one could sustain watching an episode of that show for that long. 🙃</p>
<p>By kinda-comedy, I mean “22-minute shows that are eligible for comedy awards at the Emmy’s”. The real solution here is for the Emmy’s to fix their categories in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t call “dramatic” shows that are shorter than 44 minutes comedies. This is absurd and an easy fix.</li>
<li>Unrelated to <em>The Bear</em>, currently: create separate categories for “returning shows” and “ending shows”. Emmy voters have a tendency to award shows in their last season disproportionate to their competition.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short: <em>Reservation Dogs</em> was the <strong>comedy</strong> that Emmy voters think <em>The Bear</em> is. 🌶️</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As I write this, it’s late-2024 and the job market is <em>tough</em> for jobseekers. If one finds a job within three months, they’re considered lucky. Some folks go 2–3 times longer in-between jobs. If you’re on this boat, break a leg!🫠</p>
<p>If you’re not actively seeking a job, here’s a thing that helped me go from “well this market sucks” to “welp, job seeking is my full-time job now, the only way out is through”:</p>
<p>I started warming up my professional network when things got spooky at my current job.</p>
<p>Caveat, I could have done even more than I did<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Despite not taking more steps, the simple act of thinking through “what would I do if the worst happened and my job disappeared?” put me one step ahead, <em>and</em> I was a little more calm after my job <em>did</em> disappear.</p>
<h2 id="1-the-network-is-the-work2">1. The network is the work<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></h2>
<p>A strong, active professional network is the most important tool in this scenario. This is true whether the job market favors job-seekers or employers.</p>
<p>Especially when seeking a job without one in-hand, people are happy to respond and help out<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Fifteen minutes of writing and responding to messages could kick-start the process for your next job.</p>
<p>Some helpful questions I asked myself in contemplating how to warm my network back up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who would I work with (again)? If former colleagues were especially easy, awesome, or delightful to work with one, a second outing is worth pursuing.</li>
<li>What <em>kinds</em> of places would I like to work at? I find myself particularly interested in finance-adjacent endeavors.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Tooling is also of interest, anything that makes people’s work lives better resonates with me.</li>
<li>Why not aim for the bleachers in my next role?<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> If I could work anywhere or hold any kind of role, where would it be? Perhaps there’s a role out there with all the upsides I’m looking for and very few trade-offs on the downside. Who could connect me to those roles?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-take-a-stroll-down-accomplishments-lane">2. Take a stroll down accomplishments lane</h2>
<p>Another easy thing to do<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> is get (back) in the resumé writing mindset. That is, the self-promotion mindset where you’re talking about all the things you’ve done, how great they were, putting numbers to how much they improved customer outcomes, and generally putting maximum shine on your work.</p>
<p>This is the point where I wish I had kept a good <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">brag doc</a>.</p>
<p>In lieu of a record kept in the moment, I took out some stickies and wrote out what I’d done in each of the last 6+ years at work. The goal here was to shake the dust from my brain and remember all the cool projects we shipped, excellent people I’d worked with, and improvements I’d made across the board. Keep in mind, no feat is too small and the sequence of projects doesn’t matter much! I’m only getting in the groove here. The two-ish page limit on practical resumés is forces compressing this list later.</p>
<p>Don’t feel bad about taking time to do this. At any high-functioning organization with a performance management cycle, what you’re doing here looks exactly like what you’d do for your regular performance review ceremony.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Two birds, one stone!</p>
<h2 id="2a-there-must-be-50-ways-to-write-your-resumé">2a. There must be 50 ways to write your resumé</h2>
<p>An updated resumé is a pre-requisite. I’m not (yet!) so internet-famous that I can get by without one. I didn’t start rewriting my resumé right off the bat. Instead, I dusted it off and considered how I’d change it when the time came that I needed it.</p>
<p>Writing about oneself is challenging. It feels awkward, like something one is supposed to avoid. A few insights helped me here:</p>
<ul>
<li>My resumé is the marketing/advertising that will yield the job I hold for several years of my life. Multiplied out by annual pay, this document is a tool I’m using to generate the next several hundred thousand dollars that fund my life. Basically, any time I spend on it is worthwhile.</li>
<li>Ergo, it’s worth spending <em>days</em>, all day, iterating, improving, and trying new things. It was this iteration that helped me get over the cringe of writing about myself.</li>
<li>Cover letters seem to have fallen entirely out of fashion.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Your resumé now has to do even more work. All the more reason to keep at iterating and customizing it.</li>
<li>If it helps, write your resumé like you’ve already landed the hiring manager interview.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Convince the reader that <em>they were right</em> to pull your resumé out of the stack. Tell them about <em>all</em> the great stuff you’ve done. This is where you want to refer to all your accomplishments, emphasizing the most recent and those most relevant to the kind of role you’re seeking.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-one-job-is-plenty">3. One job is plenty</h2>
<p>Looking for a new job is an exhausting endeavor. Iterating on resumés, tweaking LinkedIn profiles, and updating online presence consumes a lot of time <em>and</em> emotional energy. That’s not to mention actually finding promising jobs, customizing your resumé to suit the job descriptions, filling in application tracking system forms, responding to leads, and scheduling of interviews. Phew!</p>
<p>If you can avoid it, don’t seek a new job whilst trying to hold down another one. Especially one that has “gone spooky”. Granted, there’s a lot of luck and privilege wrapped up in that advice!</p>
<p>If your luck affords it, make the search for one’s next full-time job a full-time job. That is, give yourself a few month sabbatical to recharge and focus on the job search. Granted, don’t take this route in a market that heavily favors employers and make sure your savings are topped off in case of surprises.</p>
<hr>
<p>All this said, preparing for seeking a job is not the same as seeking a job. It took me longer than I’d have liked to realize this. Actively seeking a job, for me, looks more like marketing and sales than building or leading. It’s playing a “numbers game”: the more people you network with and the more jobs you apply for, the better. Thinking through <em>how</em> I would execute that helped!</p>
<p>But there was a hump I had to get over, entirely in my head, about actively/explicitly putting myself out there. Some social barriers I had to let go of, like not “reaching out” to folks via email or LinkedIn. Doing sales-y things, it’s a big growth area for me. 🙃</p>
<p>Finally, a thing I’m learning about this most-difficult job search of my career: every step on the job search is one step closer to finding that job.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>If you find yourself actively seeking a job, or merely feeling the spider-sense tingle about your current role, good luck! I hope this helped.</p>

<p>I’m forever feeling this one. Many times, I’ve felt the idea or plan is so clear in the document or the whiteboard. And yet, when other folks try to read the idea or execute the plan in their heads, the connection isn’t made. Back to the drawing board. 🙃</p>
<p>FWIW, “describe something well” is directly related to building software. A good domain model or intuitive UX interaction is as tricky to describe as a great movie or poem.</p>

<p>Tauri seems like it fits the bill here. It wraps a <em>native</em> web view in a small platform-specific host application. The “host” application is a Rust program that wraps a platform-specific web view, e.g., Safari on macOS. You can write native code in Rust, web/front-end code in HTML/CSS/JS, and easily call functions between them. In other words, a better Electron.</p>
<hr>
<p>Strengths become weaknesses. In theory, “JavaScript everywhere” is a lovely concept. One language across the web, backend services, command-line scripts, embedded systems, even desktop applications. In practice: it’s a thousand cuts, especially if you’re trying to avoid accepting the whole JS build system/framework ecosystem into your life. Which I was, in this case.</p>
<p>It’d be <em>extremely</em> great to have Deno save the day here. Write backend/host-native <em>or</em> front-end code in JS and very little need to drop to Rust. In practice, it doesn’t seem like anyone is doing that. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<hr>
<p>What I want to build for myself is a gizmo for re-categorizing my old blog posts. These are all hosted on Micro.blog as of this year. Because of idiosyncrasies in the Micro.blog API, interacting with <em>all</em> posts seems to require using <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/overview-of-xml-rpc-api/107">XML-RPC</a>. The REST+JSON APIs don’t provide access to more than one page of posts, so they’re unsuited to working with one’s entire blog archive<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Doing this from JavaScript, running in the web view, is where I ran into troubles. All the libraries I found assumed the code is hosted in Node, which maybe would have been fine. Node isn’t <em>drastically</em> different from browsers in this regard, if I understand correctly. <em>Except</em> that loading the actual library used the Node <code>require</code> mechanism instead of the browser-based <code>import</code> mechanism. And, it’s been a minute since I cared about the details of code loading in JS (did I ever really care?). It wasn’t really the problem I wanted to solve, so I “just tried things”, despite this being one of my pet peeves about how intermediate-level developers work.</p>
<p>Reader: I was not feeling like a badass user at this point.</p>
<hr>
<p>I wanted to write some tests with Jest. But, Jest <em>deeply</em> assumes you’re using some kind of code transformation (webpack, Babel, etc.) scheme. Which I was trying pretty hard to avoid. I did get a very basic test working, but I didn’t feel good about it.</p>
<p>I might consider using QUnit and live with in-browser tests if I choose “no build step” as a tent pole principle on a real project.</p>
<p>Long story short, I did manage to get an XML-RPC call working from a test in Jest. I never tried integrating it into the web-view code. I fought the module system enough for the week. Maybe if I revisit this approach, I’ll get my story straight here. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<hr>
<p>My next foray was attempting to write the networking calls to Micro.blog in Rust. I’ve previously struggled with Rust in the form of extended arguments with the compiler. I like the idea of the language, type system, and lifetime/borrowing scheme. But taken together, I haven’t yet reached a place of confidence working with it. My last serious attempt at using Rust, several years ago, was stymied by a combination of generics, number towers, and getting lifetimes right.</p>
<p>I did not run into those particular challenges this time around. Armed with an LLM, it feels better than several years ago! I didn’t spend the whole time arguing with the compiler. With Claude 3.5 Sonnet (IIRC), I was able to get a rudimentary XML-RPC call working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in favor of writing the backend/host-executed stuff in Rust. The jury’s still out on whether this is a plausible approach. I’ve never argued with the Haskell compiler about, e.g., JSON and walked away with a successful compilation.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>pico.css</code> is perfect for my needs. I included it with a link tag and mostly used classless HTML tags. That’s about it. No scheme of semantic, functional, or utility class names to learn. No build step. It’s good enough that looks aren’t the weakest link or distracting. That’s a good tool.</p>
<p>Similarly, I tried using Alpine to layer some interaction logic into the UI. I got hung up on declaring a data structure and then using it from any old element. I think this was a load order issue or misunderstanding on my part. Instead, I should have tried starting with basic interactions and <em>then</em> gone for the fancy stuff.</p>
<hr>
<p>The verdict, after a few hours of hacking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tauri has a lot of promise for problems shaped like “I want to build a quasi-native desktop app, but I would rather not get caught up in native ecosystems”.</li>
<li>Rust, in combination with LLM copilots, is easier to navigate than it was without them and I spent less time arguing with the compiler than I’d feared I would.</li>
<li>Small, low-customization CSS libraries: they’re good for me!</li>

<p>I was rewatching <em>Ocean’s Twelve</em>, because empty calories and fantastic faces. Having watched it a dozen times, I was struck by how it doesn’t fit together like a Major Motion Picture.</p>
<p>Many of the scenes are vignettes. They’re structured around as little as one moment or minor plot beat, like I’d expect from an unscripted show. Especially in the back half of the movie, many of the scenes watch like they’re built around a single punchline, often with background action advancing or distracting from the heist-puzzle.</p>

<p>Not a tablet with a stylus. Not a notetaking app. Not a pencil. Paper and pen.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I typically juice the cycle by writing a heading, a date, or any one liner associated with what I want to think about to get things moving. From there the mess happens, scribbles and words. They are disjointed but reconfigured with arrows. In all of that, my thinking solidifies, and the idea takes hold.</p>

<p>(via <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net">Patrick Rhone</a>)</p>
<p>Endorsed! Apps, “tools for thought”, etc. are great – don’t get me wrong. But, we all contain multitudes.</p>
<p>Some issues are well-defined and suited to computer-thinking. Other problems are wily and demand a hands-on approach. These thrive on “offline” thinking, gesturing to ourselves, thinking aloud, feeling the texture of paper, and engaged limited interaction modes (🤓).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sensation &amp; constraint of paper still beats glass. There is something about the resistance, the scratch, of a good pen across a finite sheet of paper. It’s easier for me to write “well” (opinions on my penmanship vary) on paper than on glass; something about the permanence of the ink or that my eyes are considerably higher resolution than glass displays. Filling notebook after notebook over the years and decades is vastly fulfilling in a way digital notes and writing aren’t.</p>

<p>At its best, social media is like jazz — there’s an improvisational, multi-player quality to it. Following threads, riffing, and quipping creates a collaborative rhythm all its own. I love that!</p>
<p>Then, add in the “threaded style” of social media writing and thinking. There’s a give-and-take, a call-and-response. Ideas build on each other, it’s even more like jazz.</p>
<p>Sometimes, riffs are refined via “collaborating with the network” to the point they become coherent, standalone ideas. And, like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Love_Supreme">improvisation becoming a composition</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketches_of_Spain">unto itself</a>, they become standalone essays.

			 <p>I’m dabbling in building, again. I felt the energy of XOXO for nostalgia of a web of the past, making one’s own thing, and indulging in (socially good) weird whilst doing it.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since I built a Rails app from scratch, and I don’t have a big, ambitious business plan to go with. So a blog seems like a fine place to start. 🙃🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<p>Vibes and observations follow.</p>
<h2 id="document-style-editing-in-browsers-is-a-reality">Document-style editing in browsers is a reality</h2>
<p>I’m tinkering with <a href="https://prosemirror.net/">ProseMirror</a> as an editor. I’m curious what setting a Very High-Quality bar looks like for an individual developer in late 2024. In short, it seems like document-style editing in web browsers (i.e., not Markdown or hobbled “click-to-style” editors) are close to table stakes for high-quality applications. There are many options out there, it’s probably time to get good (at one of them).</p>
<p>The default for new Rails app is to use <a href="https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails">import maps</a> for managing JavaScript dependencies. However, ProseMirror’s docs assume you’re using a bundler like <code>esbuild</code>. In particular, ProseMirror wants to import stylesheets into scope via JS <code>imports</code> and not CSS <code>@import</code>. AFAICT, importmap doesn’t gracefully bridge this gap. I’d love to be wrong about this!</p>
<p>I considered using <a href="https://tiptap.dev">TipTap</a> as a wrapper around ProseMirror. A few things put me off:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m generally wary of open source and component systems with a pricing page. I want to build, not decipher plan structures. I’m not opposed to the phenomenon entirely, but I would rather not join the vanguard of using it either.</li>
<li>I like the idea of going back to less build tooling for JS. But most of these component libraries, TipTap included, are React-centric. I’m not sure how to win here.</li>
<li><em>Some</em> component libraries support React <em>and</em> Vue. My understanding is the latter doesn’t <em>always</em> require a build step. Again, I don’t know how to win here.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-narratives">Data narratives</h2>
<p>I like the idea behind <a href="https://github.com/kaspth/oaken">Oaken</a> as an object mother/fixtures replacement. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telling <em>stories</em> instead of describing isolated data is a winning pitch.</li>
<li>Building upon Rails’ idea of seeds and using it for development <em>and</em> testing is worth trying!</li>
<li>I don’t have any beefs with <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot">FactoryBot</a>, but Oaken imposes less syntax and only a slightly different mental model, which seems like progress.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://ruby.social/@kaspth">Kasper</a> is building a track record as a Rails developer with a <a href="https://therealadam.com/2024/08/27/associated-objects-are.html">good sense of taste</a>!</p>
<h2 id="i-like-class-less-css-frameworks">I like class-less CSS frameworks</h2>
<p>My CSS skills are “barely good enough”. I’d like to master Tailwind or CSS, in an ideal world. I like that idea better than carefully coding up a UI via Swift, in theory. In practice, I’m the ideal audience/user for <a href="https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/">mvp.css</a>. Write HTML that mostly makes sense, get on with the building. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<h2 id="markup">Markup</h2>
<p>I have forgotten so much about using ERB, Rails form helpers, and HTML together. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

<p>My hot-take: the original article is, honestly, not PG’s best work and is best viewed as a jargon land-grab. That said, pointing to a blank space (fancy word: lacuna) and saying “there’s something missing here, and I have a name for whatever it is” is slightly productive. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<p>I’m a relieved that, so far, the discussion is about <em>execution</em> and thinking. It’s not about power dynamics and executive victimhood (🙄). Excessive org flattening, overloading managers with dozens of reports, and “efficiency” aren’t central to the discussion. Hopefully, those are forgotten trends of late 2022. 🤞🏻</p>

<p><a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/the-founder-mode-tradeoff">Kent Beck</a> points out that all leadership interventions on work-in-progress, from higher-status individuals in particular, yield a new mindset in which the team/startup operates. Neglect this <em>tradeoff</em> at your own peril. 👍🏻</p>
<p><a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/words-on-founder-mode/">Rands in Repose</a> focuses on the philosophy that leadership comes from <em>everywhere</em> in a startup. <em>Everyone</em> is accountable for improving the product and company__.

			 <p>My approach to writing on the web in 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write (to think, riff, share, or publish) every day.</li>
<li>Post anything over about one hundred words to my blog. Don’t worry about scheduling, publish when it’s done.</li>
<li>Every couple weeks, schedule up a bunch of social posts. Some of these are links to the blog posts from the past couple weeks. Many are ideas I haven’t figured out how to turn into longer posts <em>yet</em>.</li>
<li>Every month or so, roll up all the stuff that went out to socials and blogs in a newsletter.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>You can tell that I want you to stop and think about stock here. I feel like we all got really good at flow, really fast. But flow is ephemeral, while stock sticks around. Stock is capital. Stock is protein.</p>
<p>And the real magic trick is to put them both together. To keep the ball bouncing with your flow—to maintain that open channel of communication—while you work on some kick-ass stock in the background. Sacrifice neither. The hybrid strategy.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the attention you get with a good post on social media is like a firework: it can light up fast and burn bright, but just as fast it disappears.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the attention you get from a good blog posts can be like a forest fire: it starts small but when it catches fire it rages for some time, burning longer and more intense than any firework.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Give up on trying to be popular. I try not to filter myself based on what I believe will be popular. Some of my favourite posts get ignored. Some posts get popular and I have no idea why. Besides, terrible posts get buried fast if I’m posting three times a week. So post with abandon.</p>
<p>Give up on trying to be interesting. Readers will come to my site for what’s interesting to me, or not, it’s fine, just say what I think about whatever I’m thinking about.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Commonly shared/held wisdom: leadership is flowing decisions down and information up. What if this is (slightly) untrue? Or at least, in need of contextualizing.</p>
<p>Strategy, direction, and context are set by leadership teams based on intuitions, abstractions, and trailing and leading numbers.</p>
<p>The bottom of the org chart has a far better idea of <em>how</em> to get things done than the top. And possibly, <em>what</em> to get done such that customers can succeed. This information _should_be passed up, but it’s not <em>not</em> decision-making.</p>
<p>Seems to me there’s a disconnect and opportunity here for tactics to meet strategy. When things are going well, decisions are guided and informed, but rarely does the middle layer take decisions on its own, instead delegating to the team or below or leadership above. When ambiguity is ascendent and clarity or confidence wane, decisions <em>could</em> flow down.</p>
<hr>
<p>Contrary: information up, context down is the central conceptual model of middle management. <a href="https://jacobian.org/2021/apr/19/the-fundamental-purpose-of-middle-management/">The Fundamental Purpose of Middle Management: Context Down, Information Up</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This brings us back to the fundamental job of middle management: <strong>push context down, and information up</strong>. The job of a middle manager is to gather as much information from your reports as possible, synthesize it, and pass it up to their manager. At the same time, they should be collecting as much context from their management chain and peers, and passing that important context back down the chain. If you’re a middle manager this should be your guiding principle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Context-down should provide a coherent backdrop for whatever steering of execution a manager does.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kaspth/active_record-associated_object/tree/main">Associated objects</a> have an excellent effort-to-benefit ratio. The implementation is less than a few hundred lines of code. The docs, which fit entirely in the readme, may outweigh the actual code!

<p>There’s lots of reasons that this works but I personally believe that writing is a mechanical skill as much as it is a mental one. Sometimes you just need to run a bunch of words through your writing engine — practice the whole process, from forming a sentence in your brain down to driving the motion of your fingers — to reduce the friction to a point where you can do “real” writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As above for writing, so goes for any iterative, world-building creative activity. p.s. coding is an iterative activity wherein a world of thought-stuff is created (and sometimes checked against a computer by executing it and seeing if it all blows up.)</p>

<p>More importantly, though, we often want to somehow split these responsibilities between people. Team leadership covers a huge array of things—as you can see from how long this post is—and trying to find someone who can be great at all of them is often a unicorn hunt. Even if you do find someone good-enough at all of them, they usually spike in 1-2 areas, and it might be higher-leverage for them to fully focus on those.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in a wholly new team, this might help you find your way to traction. If you find yourself confused by the (rapidly) changing nature of work and need to zoom out on the team/role you find yourself leading, this will help!</p>
<p>Even if you’ve been in your job/team/organization for a while, to paraphrase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AINJTvRUk1w">David Byrne</a>, “You may tell yourself, this is not the job I signed up for! / My god, have I have I done?”, in which case this mental model is <em>also</em> helpful.

<h2 id="production-is-making-_social_-connections">Production is making <em>social</em> connections</h2>
<p>So you’ve got a <a href="https://therealadam.com/2024/07/13/journal-highlight-revisit.html">routine of journals and notes and active reading and such</a>. You’re turning those into blog posts and thinking <em>with</em> the network, right?</p>
<p>In particular, using networked writing (hypertext, social media) as an attractor for ideas and likeminded folks. Repeatedly engaging with those folks until a <em>new</em>, boring status quo/local maximum is reached. Iterate and seek ever higher peaks.</p>
<p>Tom Critchlow, <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/">Small b blogging</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small b blogging is learning to write and think with the network. Small b blogging is writing content designed for small deliberate audiences and showing it to them.

<p>Henrik Karlsson, <a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query">A blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason I’m spelling out this dynamic is twofold. First, you can get out of this mess if you want to. You do that by writing online (or publishing cool pieces of software, or videos, or whatever makes you tickle—as long as you work in public). Second, if you want to get out of the mess the key lies exactly in understanding that you are not the only person who has no one to talk to about the things you get obsessed by.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="production-is-a-second-order-outcome-from-consumingreading">Production is a second-order outcome from consuming/reading</h2>
<p>Consider two sorts of people: “Really Into Notes” or simply “An Enjoyer of Reading”. Either way, making things and ideas comes from connecting an idea from what you read, enthusiasm for making, and the discipline to turn that enthusiasm into action. <em>How</em> and <em>what</em> you turn that action into is left as an exercise or implementation detail up to the reader.</p>
<p>Andreas Fragner, <a href="https://www.andreasfragner.com/writing/writing-summaries">Writing Summaries Is More Important Than Reading More Books</a>, if you’re a third kind, “Extremely Okay With Marking Up Your Objects”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing I’ve learned over time is to read fewer books but to take the time to write summaries for the good ones. The ROI of spending 2h writing a synopsis is much higher than spending those 2h powering through the next book on your list. Reading is not about page count or speed [1]. What matters is how it changes your thinking and what you take away from it. Optimize for comprehension, not volume.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="production-is-doing-the-thing-you-cant-_not_-do-a-vocation">Production is doing the thing you can’t <em>not</em> do, a vocation</h2>
<p>Maybe it’s writing, but it’s cool if it’s not. Putting all these ideas together yields something <em>new</em> in the world, literal creativity. That calling, no matter the ambition or profitability or fruitfulness, is different for all of us. But we can all work the skills that support that creation.</p>
<p>Jared Henderson, <a href="https://jaredhenderson.substack.com/p/ai-wont-replace-you-unless-you-let">AI won&rsquo;t replace you, unless you let it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, there are men and women for whom being an artist if their vocation. It is what they most suited to do. I believe that determining and pursuing your vocation – even if your vocation is not your job – is crucial for a good human life, because it puts work in its proper place. Work ceases to be toil when you are pursuing your vocation.</p>

<p>Ultimately, these are one discipline: discipline.</p>

<p>Bear with me as I try to apply this lively metaphor of emotion and musical creativity to dry-and-boring engineering leadership<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The leader’s hands gesticulate, often for the aid of the speaker more than the listener. Sometimes, the hands conduct the thoughts to written words through the keyboard. Not too dissimilar from a musician’s hands through which, crucial for (most) musicians to make their sound, but equally a bit of flair.</p>
<p>The head thinks, and overthinks. Sees patterns and connects the dots. Listens to what people say and answers their questions directly and honestly. Is convinced it sees patterns in randomness, or that folks are hearing and understanding a message that they find confusing but don’t know how to address the issue.</p>
<p>The heart, for the leader, is there to mediate the head. There are other <em>people</em> on the other side of the decisions and decrees leaders make. A process or strategy is only good if it does right by those carrying it out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discipline is our capacity to make a commitment in time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discipline, in leadership, is to make a decision and then support the people executing that decision. All the while, seeking new information by which you might update, revise, or set the decision aside, if necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To have sitzfleisch means the ability to sit still for the long periods of time required to be truly productive; it means the stamina to work through a difficult situation and see a project through to the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>✋🏻 management by walking around</p>
<p>👉🏻 leadership by sitting down<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and engaging with the people doing the work</p>
<p>Even better: leadership by sustaining long period of assimilating what the team and meetings are telling you into a slightly better way of working. And sometimes, memos and slides, etc to send out and socialize ideas for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My friend Greg Wilson has argued, and I absolutely believe, that you can divide the entire computational universe into who has diff and patch, and who doesn’t. It’s the seed crystal of all workable open collaboration, and people living without it don’t even have the language to recognize how bad they’ve got it.</p>
<p>Re:re:RE:DRAFT-draft-V7-FINAL-FINAL2.doc is just no way to live, and if you live in word processors, spreadsheets, slides, art, anything without diff and patch you’re definitely feeling this pain, even if you don’t have a term for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. <code>diff</code>, along with its trusty companion <code>patch</code> is a developer superpower. (Even though <code>patch</code> came 10 years later, apparently, TIL.)</p>
<p><code>diff</code> made source control possible, so I have to think it’s in the top 5 accelerants to software development of all time<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Let alone using <code>diff</code> or <code>patch</code> under the hood in systems to move changes around.</p>
<p>Even the concept of diff is a big deal!</p>
<p>Part of the superpower of being a developer is the idea that you can analyze two pieces of data with a common lineage, extract the changes, and work with/reason about the <em>changes</em> as first-class data. Were it only that more non-developer tools had this capability!</p>

			 <p>Writing from notes is a bootstrapping problem. Anything you can do to get started, overcome static friction, and “defeat” the first blank canvas is the best thing you can do.</p>
<p>I started with journaling. Don’t worry about the quality or quantity — yet. Just write. Start with recollections of your day(s) and branch out from there.</p>
<p>There is a trough of despair, at some point. It may feel like you’re just writing into a void. Don’t reach for a “crushing your notes” course on YouTube. You’re writing now, it’s not unusual for it to take a moment (days, even weeks) to click.</p>
<hr>
<p>Next, I started reading <em>actively</em> and <em>taking highlights</em>. Tools don’t matter here. The outcomes you’re looking for are 1) getting more out of the reading than if you didn’t mark the passages that grab you, 2) coming back to the good stuff later. It’s nice that highlighting, even on mouse-and-keyboard computers, gets your hands moving and involved in the reading process.</p>
<p>Once I crested about a hundred notes/journals/highlights/etc., the next level was resurfacing past notes and revisiting/rewriting/reworking. I use random resurfacing of notes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, “on-this-day” resurfacing of journals<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and spaced repetition of highlights via Readwise. These generate insight, nostalgia, and (sometimes) the spark to connect the dots of enough ideas that a new draft comes into existence. That’s a big win! Honestly, even writing up a new note connecting some older notes or highlights feels like the system is working _for _me.</p>
<p>On a great day, the combination of resurfacing mechanisms and a bit of luck leads “a perfect post”. That is, one that connects old insights to new ideas, a quote that backs up the new insight, and a recently generated idea that ties it all together delightfully<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now I had a compounding loop of making new stuff (journals) and revisiting old stuff (highlights). Time to look for connections between them, and notice how the quality of the more recent stuff is improving over the older stuff. The temptation, particularly in a world of influencer media on note-taking<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, is to get a Big System to Lead You Right To The Big Connections in Your Thoughts. You don’t need that, you’ve got one sizzling away in your noggin, right now.</p>
<p>The revisiting and revising and rewriting is how you end up making the connections. The last generic tool I’ll recommend here is a good-old blog. For me, the insights and connections first came to me in short form, link posts and asides<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> if you will. Over time, my insights grew into a ton of notes, journals, and some short-to-medium length<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> writing on this blog.</p>
<p>In other words, what you require is not just a blog, but a blogging habit. Not just a journal, but a journaling habit. Not just the desire to connect the dots, see your ideas compound, and point proudly at a volume of work, but the habit to make all those things happen.</p>

			 <p>Yet again, the grass was not greener. I did learn a little more of simplicity-by-reduction. I asked myself, what Obsidian plugins or idioms am I using because someone else seemed to benefit a lot from it? Then I stopped using the ones that weren’t actually doing much <em>for me</em>. 💪🏻</p>
<p>I don’t need daily notes. That’s for the journal, which happens elsewhere. Daily notes might actually make my note-writing worse because I’m not above a perfunctory streak-preserving note.</p>
<p>It might even be the case that Muse is the right connecting-the-dots notes tool for me and Obsidian is more like a long-term <em>development</em> tool for preserving, archiving, and evolving ideas. 🧠</p>
<p>One of Obsidian’s advantages is the data is not opaque, its files in folders. I should use Finder more! It’s very good for dragging files around and considering organizational hierarchies. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<p>I thought just buying Bear (it’s not expensive!) would cut the envy knot. It sorta did, so that was nice for about a day. Then, almost immediately afterward, I caught word that Obsidian’s previously-vague “mobile improvements roadmap” turned out to be “improved load-time” which is half of what I wanted. Timing is everything, folks! That said, native macOS/iOS apps are just <em>excellent</em> and I hope the Obsidian developers can close that gap.</p>
<p>As far as how to use Obsidian without getting nerd sniped: <a href="https://macwright.com/2024/06/16/how-i-use-obsidian.html">Tom MacWright</a> and <a href="https://mattstein.com/thoughts/how-i-use-obsidian/">Matt Stein</a> have the right idea. At least, not <em>too</em> nerd sniped. 🤦🏻‍♂️</p>

			 <p>Should internal narratives, and the philosophies they generate, be among the guarded proprietary info within a company<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>?

<hr>
<p>Granted, many stories are used for building an image and marketing. To investors, competitors, potential hires, professional communities, etc. Or even to help teams internalize the purpose and goal of what they’re building <em>today</em>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a term for the people who&rsquo;ve been around to witness these events and craft these stories — the old guard. They&rsquo;re <em>almost</em> literally guarding the stories or narrative, but also guarding the way of working that made those stories a success.</p>
<p>These stories are often divorced from the reality of how the much bigger company now operates!</p>
<hr>
<p>Narrative is powerful. Makes sense to guard it<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.

<p>Teaching someone the depth to something like cars or pens or literature is a gift and a curse. On one hand, you’re showing them a new, deeper world that they might really enjoy and find fulfillment in. On the other, they might realize something like “a <em>true</em> classic Porsche 911” is out of reach or that the pen they like is kinda middle-ground or that their favorite sci-fi author is kinda schlocky.</p>
<p>Maybe the gift is “this is amazing, but it’s a bit of a forbidden-knowledge hazard to know you could have this thing.”</p>
<p>The classic knowledge hazard for me, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5-MoDUuRg">One car to do it all</a>. If that video hadn’t re-awoken my excitement for Porsches I would have a much more boring car, a lot more time back in my life, and mid-five figures of money spent otherwise.

<p>“If you want to upset a person for a day, tell them their taste in music sucks. If you want to upset them for life, show them the first step in the journey to seek out and appreciate the depths of really great music despite the knowledge that the most popular music is an <em>entertainment business</em> and will never reach the levels which you aspire to.”</p>

<p>Conjecture: the last 90% of a project is 90% of the effort because we rarely develop the skill of finishing.</p>

<p>Starting a new thing is more fun than finishing an existing thing. This is always the temptation!

As we’re fixing bugs, adding features, and making new possibilities, we investigate how to change the <em>structure</em> of code so that correcting, changing, or adding <em>behavior</em> is easier. In reverse order — we should make the <em>change easy,</em> then make the <em>easy change</em> to achieve the desired results<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I may not surprise you in suggesting that’s often not how things actually work out.</p>
<p>Some code, processes, or data are inherently complex or crystalized in path dependence. After our first urge to simplify is stymied, move on to the second possibility: live with and <em>document the complexity</em>, then keep moving<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Everyone wins.</p>
<p>Documenting code is a great forcing function for simplifying it. When I look at code with the intent of writing down how to use or understand it, my perspective shifts, and I’m more aware of the missing affordances. A clarifying parameter name or perhaps a simpler calling sequence. So I make that change (aka refactoring) as part of the process of documenting the code. Everyone wins.</p>
<p>The same goes for processes and data. Writing down how to fix an unprocessed payment or restore data after an accidental deletion flips my perspective enough that I’m not seeing it in the weeds. I can see opportunities for automation, so I take them. Or I can see how to improve a data structure such that errors are obvious to humans or detectable by computers. I make that change, everyone wins.</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s not always possible to find these little wins. Occasionally, we don’t win!</p>
<p>Some systems, especially the older and critical ones, resist change. The volume of data may be the resistance to change, the process may touch too many people to casually change, the risk of updating code may be too great. If you’ve worked on a billing system, I bet you’re hallucinating memories of it at the mere mention of data, process, people, and code resisting even the smallest change in course.</p>
<p>In that case, the next best way to improve the situation is to improve everyone’s knowledge of the system by writing it down. Document how it works. Even better, elaborate on how it’s <em>supposed</em> to work and how it <em>actually</em> works in some important but problematic circumstances.</p>
<hr>
<p>Go from tricky code to refactoring. If you’re stymied by refactoring, switch to documenting it instead. Everyone wins.</p>

			 <p>Alan Jacobs, <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/the-attention-cottage/">the attention cottage</a> (Via <a href="https://austinkleon.com">Austin Kleon</a>). I was not expecting to quote an attention metaphor involving the cardiovascular system and cottages, and yet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To care only for things temporal is to lose the things eternal; but to attend rightly to things eternal is the royal road to constructive thought and action in the temporal realm. The great artists and thinkers cultivate a systolic/diastolic rhythm, tension and release, an increase and then decrease of pressure. In the latter phase they withdraw, by whatever means available to them, to their attentional cottage for refreshment and clarification — and then they can return to the pressures of the moment more effectively, and in ways non-destructive to them and to others.</p>
<p>But most of us, I think, get the rhythm wrong: we spend the great majority of our time in systolic mode — contracted, tensed — and only rarely enter the relaxed diastolic phase. Or, to change the metaphor: We think we should be living in the chaotic, cacophanous megalopolis and retreat to our cottage only in desperate circumstances. But the reverse is true: our attention cottage should be our home, our secure base, the place from which we set out on our adventures in contemporaneity and to which we always make our <em>nostos</em>.</p>
<p>I often think how much easier, how much more naturally healthy, life was even just a couple of decades ago, when the internet was in one room of the house, when the whole family had one computer connected to a modem that was connected to a landline, and movies arrived in the mailbox in red envelopes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love a cottage/workshop/<a href="https://therealadam.com/2024/04/26/personal-websites-are.html">garage</a> metaphor. Doubly so when they recall a time when distraction had yet to pervade our homes and lives.</p>
<p>The past is gone, we’re not going back to Netflix DVD mailers. So how do we carry the idea of inhale/exhale and space forward? I’m trying a few things currently <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<p><strong>Minimize apps with an adversarial agenda</strong>. Currently: YouTube is only on my iPad, but the intent is I mostly watch via AppleTV. Twitter, Ivory, and Instagram are only on my phone. Reading apps (Books, Kindle, Reader, Reeder) are on all my devices. In other words, the apps aligned with my goals (read more of what I choose, think bigger thoughts) are everywhere and the ones that want to direct my attention to advertisements (mostly) are only present where my attention is (probably) already scattered.</p>
<p><strong>Hold devices to a purpose.</strong> The intent here is that I’m holding my iPad largely for reading, focus, and writing. My laptop is largely for writing, publishing, and collaboration. The Kindle is, obviously focused on reading alone, despite the predations of Amazon into all possible revenue streams elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Treat the transition to focus with reverence, if not physical space.</strong> When I’m reading or writing, I try to keep my phone out-of-reach. If not in another room. My laptop sits in a (part of the) room where I’m only focused on writing, ideas, publishing, or keeping those things operating smoothly. Whether I’m in my home office or making do on a roadtrip, this is the attention cottage Jacobs mentions above.</p>
<p>It’s not quite as quaint as an <em>actual</em> cottage. But, it does an okay job balancing the pastoral with the modern.</p>

<p>Even more difficult: don’t tell someone <em>how</em> to do it. Give context (“why”) and constraints. A few style guides perhaps (i.e., codified influence!).

<p>“In the beginner’s mind, there are many possibilities. In the expert’s mind, there are few.”</p>
<p>— Shunryo Suzuki</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trick being, how can an expert help a beginner, given they know all the false paths. And how can the expert encourage the beginner to help them find new ideas, knowing all the paths they’ve followed <em>in the past</em>?</p>
<hr>
<p>The distinguishing quality of beginner-ness is that <strong>every rock turned over has something surprising or interesting under it</strong>. It’s all rabbit holes to fall down or rakes to step on.</p>
<p>When there are no time constraints present, it’s fine to explore these ideas, some of which may not be fruitful. Or, to figure out exactly why the result was surprising and not intended.</p>
<p>When time is of the essence, being a beginner is sometimes pretty dang stressful. Doubly so when the path to productivity is littered with novelty.</p>
<p>Ergo, <a href="https://jacobian.org/2021/jul/20/make-failure-safe/">Make Failure A (Safe) Option</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I feel lucky that I was able to learn a lot about software development in high school and college. Mostly, self-directed; I used Linux during college, spent a lot of time compiling <a href="https://enlightenment.org">Enlightenment</a> and tinkering with up-and-coming languages you may have heard of, namely Python and Ruby (and to some extent, Lisp and ML).</p>
<p>Beginners today are thrown straight into narrowly guided tutorials and online courses. Then they’re dropped into the wilds of innumerable Unix minutiae, source control, relational databases, multi-paradigm programming languages, styling in browsers, and agile methods. I realized I was firmly in the “expert developer” camp when I could spot all the rabbit holes and rakes-in-leaves three moves ahead. I deftly maneuvered in the dark, knowing by feel where the potential problems were and how to avoid them.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to impart that knowledge to beginners. It’s not principles, it’s compounded experience. Worse, beginners find themselves amidst a hustle culture of “ship a side project alongside your day job and somehow do that whilst traveling the world”. Or, become a &ldquo;content creator&rdquo;. Most importantly, I knew a side-hustle and creator<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> lifestyle were not for me.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m certain beginners can help <em>me</em> find new and interesting angles. But it’s difficult to thread the needle between listening for insight and skipping ahead to what I know will work. It’s tempting to say, “I see where you’re going, but there are hazards ahead and here’s all the ways your approach could stymy us.” For one, failing is a pretty dang effective way to learn! For another, “don’t do that, I’ll tell you why later” is a pretty lousy way to acquire knowledge.</p>
<p>One lesson I’ve learned from beginners is that probably we should design systems without reliance on understanding the full depth and breadth of the computing world. Folks don’t have the time or energy to get Very Good at <code>./configure; make; make install</code><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> like I did in college.</p>
<p>Beginners are pretty good at <a href="https://therealadam.com/2024/04/11/juniorsseniors-and-incrementalvision.html">working incrementally</a>. They have to, lest they get lost in all the stepping on rakes and learning of minute! Many experienced developers have forgotten how to build incrementally. They glimpse the glass castles in the sky and plow ahead to realizing them, only to find themselves stepping on <em>different kinds</em> of rakes hidden in the leaves.</p>
<hr>
<p>Expert mistake number one: try to skip past all the beginner’s insights. That is, the beginner’s mind.</p>
<p>Teammates new to software development and new teammates on the team, accidentally or intentionally, can both reveal useful information about your team, process, and software. Information that is otherwise difficult to come by. There are things everyone is accustomed, and thus blind, to that a beginner can tell you straight away.</p>
<p>I have to remind myself that this is a critical moment. Don’t skip straight to “onboarding them onto the team’s culture” by explaining the history and the why-or-why-not. I should listen to the insight, evaluate the idea, and bias to act on it if I can.</p>
<hr>
<p>A group of experts can make great things. But a group of experts with a beginner alongside can assimilate new ideas and make great <em>and</em> interesting things.</p>

			 <p>“Try harder” is the worst kind of plan. It’s basically not a plan, a small resistance to planning. An anti-plan that signals virtue but instead reflects shallow thinking.</p>
<p>Don’t say “try harder”.</p>
<p>“Try harder” implies that folks haven’t been working hard enough. It leaves the door open to come up short again, for all the same reasons, with little to show for it.</p>
<p>It assumes folks can throw themselves at a project/problem/task even harder without consequences, like exhaustion, burnout, diminished performance, letting important part of their lives suffer, etc. Not only that, but it’s a terminating thought, the kind of thing you can say, and few people will say “well no, we can do better than that” and end up not solving any underlying issues.</p>
<p>“Try harder” is trying to avoid a tough question: why did I/we come up short last time? “Try harder” is resignation to learning nothing and plowing head-down anyway.</p>
<p>Try harder is literally working harder, not smarter. I highly recommend the latter.</p>

			 <p>Two prolific, internet-known travelers:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.996roadtrip.com">Brock Keen</a>: photographer, car camper, road-tripper, Porsche-enthusiast</li>
</ul>
<p>These gentlemen are particularly good at two things that I am not: getting outside and unplugged, and photography. (Also: walking and camping.) From the outside, their projected life/identity seems like a vacation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In particular, they take quite different sort of vacations than I do: not <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/08/02/many-parts-of.html">Disneyland</a> nor <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/08/11/this-is-where.html">dog agility-adjacent</a>.</p>
<p>They go out into the world, force a little disconnection. Setting aside this is <em>part of their thing</em>, they are separate from whatever knowledge work they might do.</p>
<p>I often want to better disconnect from my knowledge work, even for a couple of hours each night. And, it occurs to me that I can achieve that on any particular kind of vacation. <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/08/04/a-vacation-is.html">A trip to a Disney resort is a fine opportunity to shift my mind to the present</a> and to my intellectual/reading/writing interests<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="disengagement-en-route-to-thinking">Disengagement en route to thinking</h3>
<p>Mod and Keen generate a desire to think by converting walking/driving mileage into boredom and then, alchemy!, better thoughts.</p>
<p>Maybe our generally less-stimulated existences, before pervasive computing and social media, correlate with thinking better thoughts. i.e., does it require some kind of disengagement to be a Great Thinker in the age of pervasive networking and computing?</p>
<p>Keen is not specifically about thinking, <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/116/" title="“A Walk is a Platform for Creative Work”">whereas Mod is thinking adjacent</a>. Possibly, more about disengagement. Yet, something about it makes me think I could do better thoughts in something <em>like</em> that existence.</p>
<h3 id="disengagement-as-precondition-to-creativity">Disengagement as precondition to creativity</h3>
<p>What if some degree of <a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/good-ideas?utm_source=publication-search">disengagement is already table stakes</a>? Not disengagement like <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/against-waldenponding">Waldenponding</a>. More like returning to a clear mind and <a href="https://therealadam.com/2022/12/27/think-your-thoughts.html">thinking one’s own thoughts</a>. Like, you have to say no to all the distractions that you said yes to in the first place (whether accidentally over optimistically) to do a great thing/thought. <a href="https://medium.com/@the_jennitaur/how-to-do-nothing-57e100f59bbb">Jenny O’Dell has written the book on this</a>, recommended.</p>
<h3 id="vacation-is-a-tool-for-disconnection-and-disengagement-adjacency">Vacation is a tool for disconnection and disengagement adjacency</h3>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/08/04/a-vacation-is.html">A Vacation is a Tool For Disconnecting</a> amidst a few weeks wherein we vacationed in Disneyland and stayed in a friend’s RV at a public park while Courtney did dog agility. Despite this not being the most disconnected (I was, in fact, very connected) or disengaged (Disneyland is <em>quite</em> stimulating), my mind reached a good place.</p>
<p>I wasn’t dwelling on things. I could stop thinking about work once as soon as it snuck into my thoughts. I enjoyed quiet moments and didn’t rush to fill them with distractions. I photographed and journaled and jotted down ideas on the spot and posted photos to blogs. It was pretty dang good.</p>
<p>But I still found myself sitting there, half-writing and half-journaling, sort of feeling like I’m not prolific enough, even on vacation/disconnection. So maybe disconnection/disengagement isn’t the central thing. Or, ambition and aspiration are orthogonal to personal/work life splits and balances and how they manifest as some degree of “going offline”.</p>
<p>Possibly, if I were on a road trip or walking or in nature or disengaged or whatever, I would find this feeling/vibe anyway. Is that the disengagement or disconnection talking?</p>

			 <p>Anne-Laure Le Cunff, <a href="https://nesslabs.com/mental-gym">4 science-backed ways to build your own mental gym</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building mental strength is not too different from building physical strength. It’s all about consistency. The same way you would take a few minutes to do a few push ups, you can incorporate mental pushups in your daily routine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be curious:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last one is extremely powerful. Multiple <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X13000209">research</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3410">studies</a> show the positive impact teaching someone else has on the comprehension and recall of any material.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get creative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17623380">evidence</a> that practicing activities such as music, drawing, arts and crafts stimulate our brain in a way that enhances our health and well-being. These activities also have a positive impact on our <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4077746/">emotional resilience</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be mindful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose a topic. It should be personal, emotional, and important to you.
Write for yourself. Do not imagine your writing being read by other people.
Let go. Don’t worry about style, spelling, punctuation, or grammar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get some rest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A great way to combine short breaks and sleep are, of course… Naps! If you’re fortunate enough to work in an environment where taking a nap during the day is possible, do take that opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can’t overstate how good naps are. Second only to easy access to comfort from a dog, naps are the best of work-from-home benefits.</p>

			 <p>My recent experience with GitHub Copilot Chat (non-autocomplete assistance) and Raycast’s ChatGPT-3.5 integrations lead me to think that prompting will be a crucial skill for most knowledge workers. (I’m hardly the first person to this observation!) Not quite so obtusely as using a Unix shell and command-line programs is for programmers. But, still a thing one will want to know how to get the most out of.</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talking/prompting a model into doing permutations and set math. This one is still blowing my mind a little. How does a word predictor do symbolic math? Not so much a stochastic parrot in this case!</li>
<li>Coaching a model to write like me, provide useful feedback, and not use the boring/hype-y voice of Twitter or whatever a model was trained on. Hitting “regenerate” a few times to get options on different prose to include. Using the model as an always-available writing partner. In particular for “help me keep going/writing here…”.</li>
<li>Building up programs from scratch with the assistance of a Copilot. Incrementally improving. Asking it for references on how to understand the library in question. Asking it for ideas on how to troubleshoot the program. I’ve used this to generate the boilerplate to get started with <a href="https://codemirror.net">CodeMirror</a>, with <em>some</em> success.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simon Willison, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/23/building-c-extensions-for-sqlite-with-chatgpt-code-interpreter/">Building and testing C extensions for SQLite with ChatGPT Code Interpreter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the infuriating things about working with ChatGPT Code Interpreter is that it often denies abilities that you know it has.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A non-trivial share of the prompting here is to remind ChatGPT “this is C and <code>gcc</code>, you know this”. I am not sure whether to eye-roll or laugh. Maybe part of the system prompt is “occasionally, you’ll require a little extra encouragement, just like a less-experienced human.” Simon <em>did</em> manage to give ChatGPT enough courage to build the extension, though!</p>
<p>Despite needing to encourage the thing, this bit is promising:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the thing I enjoy most about using Code Interpreter for these kinds of prototypes: since the prompts are short, and there’s usually a delay of 30s+ between each prompt while it does its thing, I can do the whole thing on my phone while doing other things.</p>
<p>In this particular case I started out in bed, then got up, fed the dog, made coffee and pottered around the house for a bit—occasionally glancing back at my screen and poking it in a new direction with another prompt.</p>
<p>This almost doesn’t count as a project at all. It began as mild curiosity, and I only started taking it seriously when it became apparent that it was likely to produce a working result.</p>
<p>I only switched to my laptop right at the end, to try out the macOS compilation steps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ilia Choly, <a href="https://choly.ca/post/semgrep-autofix-llm/">Semgrep: AutoFixes using LLMs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the built-in autofix feature is powerful, it’s limited to simple AST transforms. I’m currently exploring the idea of fixing semgrep matches using a Large Language Model (LLM). More specifically, each match is individually fed into the LLM and replaced with the response. To make this possible, I’ve created a tool called semgrepx, which can be thought of as xargs for semgrep. I then use semgrepx to rewrite the matches using the fantastic llm tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve yet to land a big automated refactoring generated solely by abstract syntax tree-powered refactoring tools. By extension, I definitely haven’t tried marrying AST-based mass refactoring with an LLM. But it sounds neat!</p>

			 <p>The ability to focus on one concern at a time is the mark of a senior developer. It takes experience to ignore other factors as noise. It takes time to learn how to avoid tripping on distractions and side-quests.</p>
<p>Ben Nadel, <a href="https://www.bennadel.com/blog/4352-only-so">Only Solve One Problem at a Time</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This lesson hits me hard in the feels because when I reflect on my own work history, some of the biggest mistakes that I&rsquo;ve made in my career revolve around trying to solve multiple problems at the same time. Perhaps one of the most embarrassing examples of this is when I was attempting to learn OOP (Object Oriented Programming) on a new project. This was two problems: I had to build a new application; and, I tried to do it in a new programming paradigm.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the project ended up coming in months late and was a horrible mess of hard-to-maintain code. Trying to solve two problems at the same time ended in disaster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nearly universal advice for developers of all experience levels!</p>
<p>The trick for juniors is, they’re always learning more than one thing at a time, often on accident. They want to build a feature, but it requires a new library, and it requires learning the library. They went to start up a development server, but then something weird happens with Unix. It’s the essential challenge of being a junior – they’re just getting started, so they’re always learning a couple of things at a time.</p>
<p>Perversely, a senior who can see the whole feature/change in their head is sometimes tempted to push the whole thing through in one (large) change. They’re tempted to make the entire thing happen in one outburst of crisp thinking.</p>
<p>Developers who have learned to avoid pitfalls and gotchas sometimes have to relearn how to work incrementally. Juniors (frequently) don&rsquo;t have this problem. If they don&rsquo;t work incrementally, they won&rsquo;t make progress at all! (Caution: juniors that try to work like the seniors they see around them <em>will</em> fall into this trap.)</p>
<p>That said, juniors <em>and</em> seniors both tend to struggle with:</p>
<ul>
<li>deciding when to focus vs. when to jump out of a rabbit hole</li>
<li>building their own feedback loops with tests/compilers, jigs/scaffolding</li>
<li>imagining and applying constraints</li>
<li>using first-principle thinking to reduce the overwhelming possibility space of programming</li>
</ul>
<p>These skills don’t come with simple experience. One has to <em>decide</em> to apply them and <em>then</em> build up experience using them to keep development on-track, focused, and effective.</p>

			 <p>In America, the 2024 election cycle is unlikely to amuse <em>anyone</em>. Maybe this is a rallying point for “unifying” the country: a near-universal loathing of our politicians, how they get themselves elected, and the outcomes they deliver to us. Let alone the new media that reports on them.</p>
<p>Ahead of the inevitable hell-cycle, I’ve trimmed my attention sails a bit. The general idea is to remove feeds and notifications from my daily routine which are monetized primarily by writing doom-y, grab-y headlines. I’m looking at you in particular, <em>New York Times</em>. But it applies to just about everything with headlines. I’ve disabled all notifications from <em>The Economist</em> and Apple News. I read them once a week. That’s plenty.</p>
<p>Unrelated to the election, I deleted the Twitter and Instagram apps. The web app is mostly equivalent in Twitter’s case, no loss there. Instagram’s mobile web app is surprisingly mediocre. The point, in both cases, is to put a few more steps, a bit more friction, between me and randomly scrolling an algorithmic, attention-hungry feed. I’ve since found that the friction of loading these two as web apps is <em>great</em>. I do indeed look at them far, far less. On the other hand, their web apps are intentionally just-okay. It seems to me that any organization that can put together an excellent iOS app should be able to do the same on mobile web. Reader, let me tell you, they don’t.</p>
<p>I found the settings in Lyft and DoorDash that prevent them from sending advertisements-as-push-notifications. They do exist! Highly recommended.</p>
<p>Mute lists, they’re also fantastic. All the names and teams and keywords that tend to mean “here’s a post about the political horse-race” are scrubbed from my timeline. Even better, I can see when they’re scrubbed and dip in to see if things are as unproductive as I remember. (Thanks for that little detail, <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a>.)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Allow me a bit of a soapbox-rant. A spicy take, as we might say these days.</p>
<p><strong>You’re using the ternary operator wrong in Ruby, JavaScript, and almost everything else. It’s for expressions, not control flow.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>My personal ternary journey of discovery, delight, and distaste:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the old C days: what is this noise? What does a colon even mean in this language? Is this even syntactically valid?</li>
<li>Later, in verbose languages like Java: oh I get it, let me show off by using it. I like that I can compress five simple lines of conditional down to one.</li>
<li>Currently, seeing how it’s used in shell and React code: actually this is awful let&rsquo;s never use this. Delineating the arms of a conditional with one character is awful for scanning and discovery code.</li>
<li>Even when it’s appropriate, I feel a little bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>The nuanced take: a one-condition ternary with no more than 4 tokens is maybe okay. If I can’t fit my ternary expression in 80 characters, switch to an if/else conditional. (It’s not that bad!)</p>
<pre><code>// fine, I guess
foo = bar ? baz : quux

// stop this, I'm begging you
msg = bar ? ...dozens of lines of code
          : ...dozens more lines of code
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>Why I try to avoid it:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the year 2024, your editor can write conditionals for you
<ul>
<li>some folks can&rsquo;t even keep your ternaries at 10 tokens, let alone 5</li>
<li>and it’s literally showing</li>
<li>hence, I’m here writing about it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the ternary operator is not for control flow, stop that
<ul>
<li>the ternary operator is really only suitable for assigning values based on other values
<ul>
<li>for example, in the expression <code>val = foo ? bar : baz</code></li>
<li><code>val</code> depends on <code>foo</code></li>
<li>the ternary operator is a good way to represent dependency/correlation!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t care what React&rsquo;s conventions are anymore
<ul>
<li>they’re not good in this regard</li>
<li>use conditionals for control flow</li>
<li>use variables to assign meaningful names to big chunks of markup</li>
<li>please, stop with the boolean and ternary logic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m literally writing this before the sun rises, asking you to stop</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ternaries don&rsquo;t airlift/refactor well
<ul>
<li>you can&rsquo;t pluck one bit of code out of a ternary and drop it somewhere else</li>
<li>I feel this one in my bones but can’t think of a short example</li>
<li>(citation needed)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Bonus track: stop adding conditional clauses!</p>
<pre><code>// fine
if safe-to-release
  launch-the-missiles
else
  reset-to-ready
end

// bad, you got some refactoring to do
if safe-to-release &amp;&amp; target-acquired &amp;&amp; something-that-seemed-right-once &amp;&amp; tuesday || national-holiday
...
end
</code></pre>
<p>I&rsquo;m guilty of this temptation to add “just one more conditional!” I regret it.</p>
<p>It makes code difficult to reason about. It’s basically impossible to tell people <em>when</em> the thing will happen in the “bad” example.</p>
<p>If you manage to get something right in multiple conditions today, you&rsquo;re probably only making it harder for yourself (or someone else) tomorrow.</p>
<p>I will support you 90% of the time if you want to take 30 extra minutes to turn a multi-clause condition into a simpler structure. Your teammates will hail you as a hero later when they need to read or modify said simpler structure!</p>
<hr>
<p>A disproportionate percentage of bugs hide in conditionals. If they’re easier to read and change, hopefully we’ll write fewer bugs!</p>

			 <p>Every experienced Rails developer should pick up Garrett Dimon’s <a href="https://garrettdimon.com/products/frictionless-generators"><em>Frictionless Generators</em></a>. Generators are an often overlooked piece of the Rails puzzle. The book shines a light on getting the most out of generators in your Rails projects. It’s an amazing-looking digital object too, the illustrations are great.</p>
<p>(Before I go further, it’s worth noting that Garrett Dimon sent me a review copy, acted on my feedback, and is generally a pal.)</p>
<h2 id="you-should-customize-generators-and-write-your-own">You should customize generators and write your own</h2>
<p>Conventions, in the form of assumptions that are woven into the framework’s code but also exist as a contract of sorts, are essential to Rails. Following those conventions would not work well if creating a new model, resource, etc. wasn’t made easy <em>and consistent</em> without our friends <code>rails generate resource/model/etc</code>. These generators have been present in Rails since the beginning. I’ve used them hundreds of times and thought nothing of it.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I realized that generators had become a public API in Rails and that re-use was encouraged. The <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html">guide is a good start</a>. I was able to knock out a simple generator for a novel, but conventional, part of our application. In the process, I realized a couple of things.</p>
<p><strong>No one likes boilerplate and tedium</strong>. Generators automate the tedium of boilerplate. This is particularly helpful to less experienced developers, who are likely a bit overwhelmed with trying to comprehend decades of Rails evolution and legacy code (from their perspective) quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Rails developers are under-utilizing this leverage</strong>. Every system that makes it past a few thousand lines of code (or several months in use) develops bespoke conventions. These are easier to follow if you can reduce the mental burden to “when you add a new thingy, run <code>rails g thingy</code>”. Added bonus: starting new conceptual pieces in your app from generators encourages consistency, itself an under-appreciated sustaining element in long-lived Rails applications.</p>
<p>Luckily, someone was thinking the same thing I was…</p>
<h2 id="garrett-knows-more-about-generators-than-anyone-i-know">Garrett knows more about generators than anyone I know</h2>
<p>The Rails guides for generators are okay. They whet the curiosity and appetite. But, they aren’t particularly deep. When I first tinkered with generators, I mostly learned by reading the code for <code>rails generate model/resource/etc</code>.</p>
<p><em>Frictionless Generators</em> does not require one to jump right into reading code. It opens with ideas on the possibilities of developing with custom generators. Then, it moves onto the practicalities of writing one’s own generator and crafting a good developer experience. From there, it’s down the rabbit hole: learning about the APIs for defining generators, implementing the file-creation logic therein, writing help and documentation for them, generating files from templates, and customizing the built-in Rails generators.</p>
<p>Garrett goes into as much depth on generators as any other technical author I know, on any topic. Did you know you can make HTTP requests and use their responses in generators? I did not, but Garrett does! Did you know that generators apply the same kind of “oh, yeah, that’s common sense” convention for copying files from generators into applications? I did not, but Garrett does! I don’t think I’d use all these ideas on every generator, but I like the idea that I can return to <em>Frictionless Generators</em> should I have an idea and wonder how the existing, low-friction APIs can help me.</p>
<p>Further, Garrett offers frequent insights into the <em>developer experience</em> and <em>leverage</em> of building generators. On building generators for “fingertip feeling” so developers can easily (and frequently!) use them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like to aim for no more than one value argument and one collection argument to keep generators easier to use. Everything else becomes an option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On approaching generators as high-leverage side-quests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that the ease of use is generally inversely proportional to the length of your documentation. Assistance first. Brevity second. Content third. Or, be helpful first, concise second, and thorough third. That said, there are a few other categories of information that can be helpful.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>For me, a good technical book balances presentation of technical information, the right amount of detail, and wisdom on how to apply the two in practical ways. Garrett succeeds at striking that balance while keeping things moving and easy to follow.</p>
<p>In short, recommended! Rails generators are underrated, whether you’re aware of their existence or not. Smart teams are customizing generators and writing their own bespoke generators. <a href="https://garrettdimon.com/products/frictionless-generators">There’s a book on this now</a>, which you should check out if any of this resonated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve talked about this before in the context of prototyping and play and how we worked at Paravel. It’s a lot like playing baseball; each member of the team showing up to practice, volleying work (in screenshots, short videos, or demos), pushing changes, communicating thoughts and challenges in the moment outside the confines of slotted meeting times. Me and my coworkers, having a catch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several years ago, when I was doing improv, I was rehearsing for a musical, of all things. At the same time we were getting started with table reads and gel’ing as a cast, two other shows were rehearsing in the same theater. One show was about to open, very much having their thing dialed in. Another cast was somewhere in the middle, having figured out what they were about but still trying to get the execution just right. Everywhere in the theatre, there was creation and exploration energy and it was one of the most awesome things I’ve done. This despite not liking musical theater much!</p>
<hr>
<p>I don’t like the idea of “return to office” and I don’t think you could make it work anyway. The social momentum that kept a critical mass of people in one office has been broken, you can’t put that toothpaste back in the tube.</p>
<p>That said, I have yet to feel that same energy in remote work that I did in a local theatre on rehearsal night while various groups were <em>making</em> something <em>together</em>, in the <em>moment</em>, and iterating on it as quickly as they could share a glance or read through a scene.</p>
<p>I bet <em>some</em> teams have figured out how to feel this way in remote/async setups. But, it feels like most are still running the old in-person playbook that we learned, and sometimes thrived with, over the past years and decades of our careers.</p>

			 <p>Julia Galef, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scout_Mindset"><em>The Scout Mindset</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “self-belief” model of motivation assumes that if you acknowledge the possibility of failure, then you’ll be too demoralized or afraid to take risks. In that model, people who believe that failure is unthinkable are the ones who try the hardest to succeed. Yet in practice, things often seem to work the other way around—accepting the possibility of failure in advance is liberating. It makes you bold, not timid. It’s what gives you the courage to take the risks required to achieve something big.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the most impactful ways I’ve adapted my thinking over the years, if only modestly successfully, has been to fear failure less and accept small downsides more easily. There’s way more world out there for those willing to trip or even fall now and then.</p>

<p>Recipe for living a good life in the shell:</p>

</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>A sage developer once told me he didn’t maintain dotfiles at all. He worked across so many machines and servers that keeping a shell configuration working across many systems was folly. Instead, the most important thing for him was making sure his shell <em>history</em> was synced across all those computers.</p>
<p>At first, I thought this was merely amusing. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized how deeply wise it is. Dotfiles, in the form of functions and aliases, abstract <em>and</em> ossify, the commands you <em>think</em> you’ll run frequently. But reverse searching through your total shell history provides you with access to commands you <em>have</em> run and lets you quickly edit/adapt them in-situ.</p>
<p>This makes the history file for your shell (possibly) the most significant file on your computer. Not just because it’s useful, but as a working memory and a reflection of your <em>journey</em>.</p>

			 <p>Virtuosity and speed are nice, in music and life. But you leave some space between the notes or slow things <em>way</em> down? Make some space in between the music for the <em>music</em> to happen? Now you’re cooking something good. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aretha Franklin, the greatest of all time at making the most of the space between notes. As I’m fond of saying: there is no song Aretha Franklin could not perform slower <em>and</em> better than anyone else. Compare the tempo of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BDw-H_hUzw">Otis Redding’s <em>Respect</em></a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3Itb17PXvw">Aretha’s version</a>, both recorded in the same year.</li>
<li>AC/DC, “Back In Black” or “Highway To Hell”. This is where I’d start rock and roll songwriting 101.</li>
<li>D’Angelo, “Untitled (How Does It Feel?)”. Most of his work is an exemplar, he’s a master of making songs feel <em>spacious</em>.</li>
<li>Joe Cocker, “With A Little Help From My Friends”. Take a jaunty, mid-tier Beatles song and draw it <em>way</em> out. This makes room for the huge, stacked vocals chorus. Suddenly, it’s right in the feels.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>First: use them! Most frameworks have a project boilerplate and that’s it. Rails’ ability to quickly lay down a conventional resource, model, or anything else is a productivity booster. Use it!</p>
<p>Second: experiment with the commands before you run them. Try Harrison Broadbent’s, <a href="https://railsg.xyz">RAILSG · Ruby on Rails Generator Reference and Command Builder</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RAILSG is a collection of Ruby on Rails generator command references, and command builders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Third, write your own. When your app gets traction, you’ll probably invent a couple of conventions of your own. Use generators to quickly write new code consistently. Garrett Dimon has become the expert on this, <a href="https://garrettdimon.com/journal/posts/creating-custom-rails-generators">Creating Custom Rails Generators</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rails generators can help remove significant friction from the process of spinning up new ideas, but you don&rsquo;t have to limit yourself to the included generators. You can also create custom generators as long as you&rsquo;re familiar with the available APIs and know where the speed bumps are.</p>

			 <p>Funk is unique amongst musical genres, in my perspective, due to the importance of the notes <em>you don’t play</em>. The <em>space</em> between notes, and not “shredding” every possible moment, is important in all genres. But I find that the funkiest stuff gets that way from missing expected notes and shifting expected notes to moments where they shouldn’t be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Funk was a rhythmic system of tension and release over time, but also simultaneous tension between some players exercising maximum restraint and others exhibiting maximum expressiveness. Most of all, funk was a science of subverted expectations, syncopation taken to its ultimate destination. With funk, things weren’t always where you thought they’d be.</p>

			 <p>My experiments (with <a href="https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot">obsidian-copilot</a>) have yet to yield a satisfying intersection between LLMs and Obsidian. I generally find OpenAI’s models write too much like breathless clickbait instead of an interesting human. I don’t want a summary or rewrite of my notes generated in that style. For querying/searching/discovery, OpenAI’s notebook-esque web interface is fine.</p>
<p>I’m still hoping to come across something that uses indexing and embedding to help me organize and connect notes I wrote, by my hand, in intriguing and novel ways. 🤞🏻</p>
<p>That said, if you’re already running an LLM locally via <a href="https://ollama.ai">llama</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hinterdupfinger/obsidian-ollama/tree/main">obsidian-ollama</a> looks like an excellent way to integrate it into your note-writing/knowledge management scheme. The code of this plugin is easy to follow and nicely structured, making it a good one to look at when the temptation to write Obsidian plugins comes. (Which, for me, arrives as a potential distraction more often than I’d like!) Disclaimer: I haven’t tried this one yet!</p>

			 <p>I have an elaborate, perhaps baroque, setup of journals, notes, tasks, highlights, read-it-laters, feeds, and canvases-for-thinking. I consider it a crucial, and very idiosyncratic, piece of “knowledge worker infrastructure”. Furthermore, I don’t think I could handle a lot of the work and projects that I do, to the extent that I do, without it.</p>
<p>But, I hope that constructing such a scheme, and doing all the time intensive background research and tinkering, is not something <em>everyone</em> would have to expend effort on to think better and more clearly.</p>
<p>My hunch here is that the software bundled with iOS/iPadOS/macOS is <em>very close</em> to allowing folks who just want to remember and brainstorm get started <em>immediately</em>. Currently, a couple of elements are missing. This means you have to hit the third-party ecosystem escape hatch and consider a <em>daunting</em> variety of applications, workflows, and identity/quasi-religions.</p>
<p>Herein, a wishlist of system-level capabilities that would make macOS an even better “bicycle for the mind”.</p>
<hr>
<p>In any old macOS app, I want to highlight text (mostly) with any pointer (mouse, stylus, finger) on any device (laptop, tablet, phone) and capture/promote text. I may want to add my commentary or notes too. Afterward, I should be able to search for this in Spotlight, at the least. Even better if the whole document/page/file/etc. the text came from is indexed, so I can find highlights despite imperfect memory.</p>
<p>macOS already extracts contacts and events from plain text. Faces are identified in photos. Why not make text excerpts/highlights/passages a first-class thing in the system’s information architecture?</p>
<hr>
<p>I want to identify key ideas, concepts, people, and other nouns, so I can hyperlink between them <em>and</em> navigate them in <em>something</em> like the Finder.</p>
<p>This verbs-and-nouns concept was key to AppleScript. I’ve read that it was part of the conceptual bedrock of NeXTStep, but I haven’t found more than a few passing sentences on that.</p>
<p>Why not carry that idea forward or rediscover it on macOS? Some folks want to do more than scroll, post, and transact.</p>
<hr>
<p>Notes and Journal, along with Finder and Spotlight, seem <em>very close</em> to checking all the boxes here. 🤷🏻‍♂️I don’t use those apps, so I’m wildly speculating here. Out over my skis, as they say. That said, this is <em>so close</em> to the core of what you really need to do next-level, thinking-augmented-by-computers.</p>
<p>Even though I use very particular apps, I feel like Apple has the right foundations here. A journal app for capturing ideas, reflections, and life as it happens. A notes app for putting structure and organization around the ideas that emerge from those moments. Tie it together with search to resurface and rediscover those journals and notes.</p>
<p>A fellow can dream, right?</p>

<p><a href="https://ia.net/topics/ia-writer-7">iA Writer</a>’s integration is the first use of LLMs I’ve seen that I’d consider original. They didn’t slap on a chat interface where one wasn’t needed. It’s not autocomplete-but-smarter.</p>
<p>Instead, they show authorship/origin of text as either human or machine-generated. As you edit out the AI machine’s writing, the text visually and literally becomes more your own creation. You engage in dialog with the machine and use that to <em>improve</em> your thinking. The machine doesn’t think for you. Bravo!</p>

After all, you presumably don&rsquo;t feel overwhelmed by all the unread books in the British Library – and not because there aren&rsquo;t an overwhelming number of them, but because it never occurred to you that it might be your job to get through them all.</p>
<p>I like to think of it as the productivity technique to beat all productivity techniques: finally internalizing the implications of the fact that what&rsquo;s genuinely impossible – the clue is in the name! – cannot actually be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You cannot actually read, process, and comment upon the whole internet, or even your little corner of interesting discourse. But, you can click “Mark All As Read” and move on. River-of-news style timelines automate marking items unread instead of automating bringing you the good stuff. <a href="https://reederapp.com">Reeder</a> and <a href="https://www.newsblur.com/">NewsBlur</a> have options for it. I bet others do too. <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2021/09/28/rewinding-your-attention/">Reclaim your attention</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, most advice on productivity and time management takes the needle-in-a-haystack approach instead. It&rsquo;s about becoming more efficient and organised, or better at prioritising, with the implied promise that you might thereby eliminate or disregard enough of life&rsquo;s unimportant nonsense to make time for the meaningful stuff. To stretch a metaphor: it&rsquo;s about reducing the size of the haystack, to make it easier to focus on the needle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely a role for such techniques; but in the end, the only way to deal with a too-many-needles problem is to confront the fact that it&rsquo;s insoluble – that you definitely won&rsquo;t be fitting everything in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a question of rearranging your to-do list so as to make space for all your &ldquo;big rocks&rdquo;, but of accepting that there are simply too many rocks to fit in the jar. You have to take a stab at deciding what matters most, among your various creative passions/life goals/responsibilities – and then do that, while acknowledging that you&rsquo;ll inevitably be neglecting many other things that matter too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m guilty here! All the best in task management, getting things done, note-taking, journal writing, and even <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/11/01/saying-no-is.html">saying no</a> won’t get the work done. I have to take the gift of clarity and focus generated by all these routines, and <em>do that “big rock” important thing</em>. I have to find peace with the trade-off of doing one thing instead of all the other exciting things.</p>
<p>Or, maybe <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/11/16/smaller-barriers-to.html">generative AIs</a> will provide Walt Disney-like agency to direct and sustain diverse projects outside my expertise with Imagineering-quality output. Wouldn’t it be nice!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In chess, which for decades now has been dominated by A.I., a player’s only hope is pairing up with a bot. Such half-human, half-A.I. teams, known as centaurs, might still be able to beat the best humans and the best A.I. engines working alone. Programming has not yet gone the way of chess. But the centaurs have arrived. GPT-4 on its own is, for the moment, a worse programmer than I am. Ben is much worse. But Ben plus GPT-4 is a dangerous thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think AI assisted programming is going to shave a lot of the frustration off learning to code, which I hope brings many more people into the fold</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve entered the age of AI-powered coding, writing, speaking, and painting centaurs.</p>
<p>If we play our cards right, we will lower barriers to entry <em>and</em> raise the ceiling of possibility to new levels. If more people can <em>create</em> in mediums that are considered specializations now, that <em>might</em> open allow experts to go deeper in their specialization or branch out into areas that were inaccessible without compromising their specialization.</p>
<p>The idea of a dilettante, a person who cultivates an area of interest, such as the arts, without real commitment or knowledge, might become acute or obsolete. We might end up with a new level of “yuck that looks some amateurish and <em>generated</em>”. Or we might end up with reviews like “the artist deftly combines generated and hand-drawn sketches with procedurally generated music modeled on their own previous album <em>I Play Pianos, By Hand, Like Duke Did</em>”.</p>
<p>Of course, we’ve heard this story before and famed economist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes">Keynes</a> is (infamous?) for predicting mechanical automation would all have us exploring our favorite hobbies at this point. So, we gotta play our cards right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As part of that, I made the difficult decision to call my publisher to push my next book a year or so. This was a massive clearance on my schedule—several hours a day did not have to be spent researching and writing on a project. Yet it was remarkable how little my life changed. Because tasks expand to fill the space, because it is so easy to say yes to other things. <em>Less</em> demands vigilance and discipline, perhaps even more effort than actually doing stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reward for saying no feels like saying yes to a more important thing. But you still need decision discipline after that first “no”.</p>
<p>Whenever I&rsquo;ve heard things like &ldquo;the key to serene focus and productivity is saying no more often&rdquo;, it often seems like saying &ldquo;no, thanks&rdquo; on projects and potential work is the top of the hill. Like it&rsquo;s all downhill to doing great work from there. Say no, they say, puts you on easy street to writing the great American novel/album/YouTube channel/large language model.</p>
<p>Alas, saying no is not one weird trick for exercising all of your decision-making and discipline in one crucial moment. Making great stuff requires many small moments of saying no. Say no to looking up that frivolous fact. Say no to the pull of social media. Say no to taking a day off your habit of making great stuff. Say no to that Oreo cookie. ☹️</p>

			 <p>George Saunders on <a href="https://georgesaunders.substack.com/p/office-hours-8e8">getting past self-critical/low-energy writing spirals</a> (aka one of the many forms of writer’s block):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another thing I sometimes suggest is this: stop writing. That is, stop doing your “real” writing. Yank yourself out of your usual daily routine. Instead, today, off the top of your head, write one sentence. Don’t think about what it should be about, or any of that. Just slap some crazy stuff down on the page. (Or it can be sane stuff. The “slapping down” is the key.) Print it out. Then, go do something else and, over the next 24 hours, do your best not to give that sentence a single thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complete method, in my own words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a sentence, nothing in particular. Just start.</li>
<li>Return to that sentence daily, making additions or changes that feel right.</li>
<li>As the thing grows from a sentence to a paragraph and so on, spend more time with it. But don&rsquo;t sweat the magnitude of the output. A trivial punctuation change is &ldquo;a good day&rsquo;s work&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Get bolder in the changes. Do what you prefer and don&rsquo;t worry about why it is you gravitate towards that particular change.</li>
<li>Resist the urge to switch from working on an exercise to working your routine/process. Keep growing it instinctively.</li>
<li>Eventually you have a whole story/essay/whatever written this way and you&rsquo;re happy to do something with it.</li>
<li>Now you are un-stuck.</li>

			 <p><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/index.html"><code>llm</code></a> (<a href="https://til.therealadam.com/2023/08/27/llm-is-a.html">previously</a>) is a tool Simon Willison is working on for interacting with large language models, running via API <em>or</em> locally.</p>
<p>I set out to use <code>llm</code> as the glue for prototyping tools to generate embeddings from one of my journals so that I could experiment with search and clustering on my writings. Approximately, what I’m building is an ETL workflow: extract/export data from my journals, transform/index as searchable vectors, load/query for “what docs are similar to or match this query”.</p>
<h2 id="extract-and-transform-approximately">Extract and transform, approximately</h2>
<p>Given a JSON export from DayOne, this turned out to be a matter of shell pipelines. After some iterations with prompting (via Raycast’s GPT3.5 integration), I came up with a simple script for extracting entries and loading them into a SQLite database containing embedding vectors:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
# extract-entries.sh
# $ ./extract-entries Journals.json

file=$1
cat $file |
  jq '[.entries[] | {id: .uuid, content: .text}]' |
  llm embed-multi journals - \ # [1]
    --format json \
    --model sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 \ # [2]
    --database journals.db \
    --store
</code></pre>
<p>A couple things to note here:</p>
<ol>
<li>The placement of the <code>-</code> parameter matters here. I’m used to placing it at the end of the parameter list, but that didn’t work. The <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/cli.html#llm-embed-multi"><code>llm embed-multi</code></a> docs suggest that <code>--input</code> is equivalent, but I think that’s a docs bug (the parameter doesn’t seem to exist in the released code).</li>
<li>I’m using locally-run model to generate the embeddings. This is very cool!</li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, <code>llm embed-multi</code> takes one JSON doc per line, expecting <code>id/content</code> keys, and “indexes” those into a database of document/embedding rows. (If you’re thinking “hey, it’s SQLite, that has full search, why not both: yes, me too, that’s what I’m hoping to accomplish next!)</p>
<p>I probably could have just built this by iterating on shell commands, but I like editing with a full-blown editor and don’t particularly want to practice at using the zsh builtin editor. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<h2 id="load-of-a-sort">Load, of a sort</h2>
<p>Once that script finishes (it takes a few moments to generate all the embeddings), querying for documents similar to a query text is also straightforward:</p>
<pre><code># Query the embeddings and pretty display the results
# query.sh
# ./query.sh &quot;What is good in life?&quot;
query=$1

llm similar journals \
  --number 3 \
  --content &quot;$query&quot; |
  jq -r -c '.content' | # [1]
  mdcat # [2]
</code></pre>
<p>Of note, two things that probably should have been more obvious to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don’t need to write a for-loop in shell to handle the output of <code>llm similar</code>; <code>jq</code> basically has an option for that</li>
<li>Pretty-printing Markdown to a terminal is trivial after <code>brew install mdcat</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I didn’t go too far into clustering, which also boils down to one command: <code>llm cluster journals 10</code>. I hit a hiccup wherein I couldn’t run a model like LLaMa2 or an even smaller one because of issues with my installation.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-learned">Things I learned!</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>jq</code> is very good on its own!
<ul>
<li>and has been for years, probably!</li>
<li>using a copilot to help me take the first step with syntax using <em>my own</em> data is the epiphany here</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>llm</code> is quite good, doubly so with its growing ecosystem of plugins
<ul>
<li>if I were happier with using shells, I could have done all of this in a couple relatively simple commands</li>
<li>it provides an adapter layer that makes it <em>possible</em> to start experimenting/developing against usage-priced APIs and switch to running models/APIs locally when you get serious</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it’s feasible to do some kinds of LLM work on your own computer
<ul>
<li>in particular, if you don’t mind trading your own time getting your installation right to gain independence from API vendors and usage-based pricing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mission complete: I have a queryable index of document vectors I can experiment with for searching, clustering, and building applications on top of my journals.</p>

			 <p>(Previously: <a href="https://til.therealadam.com/2023/09/03/building-a-language.html">Building a language model from scratch, from a tutorial</a>)</p>
<p>I started to get a little impatient in transcribing linear algebra code <a href="https://blog.briankitano.com/llama-from-scratch/">from the tutorial</a> into my version. In part, it’s tedious typing. More interesting, GitHub Copilot trying to autocomplete the code was sometimes right and sometimes the wrong idiom and actively deciding which was which compounded the tedium. This is a big lesson for our “humans-in-the-loop supervise generative LLMs” near-future. 😬</p>
<p>OTOH, when I got to the part where an attention head was implemented, it made <em>way</em> more sense having read <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention is All You Need</a> previously. That feels like a big level-up: reading papers <em>and</em> working through implementations thereof brings it all together in a big learning moment. Success! 📈</p>

			 <p>I’m working from <a href="https://blog.briankitano.com/llama-from-scratch/">Brian Kitano’s Llama from scratch (or how to implement a paper without crying)</a>. It’s very deep, so I probably won’t make it <em>all</em> the way through the long-weekend I’ve allocated for it.</p>
<p>I’ve skimmed the paper, but didn’t pay extremely close attention to the implementation details. But the tutorial provides breadcrumbs into the deeply math-y bits. No problems here.</p>
<p>I noticed that there are <a href="https://ankane.org/ruby-ml-for-python-coders">Ruby bindings for most of these ML libraries</a> and was <em>tempted</em> to try implementing it in the language I love. But I would rather not get mired in looking up docs or translating across languages/APIs. And, I want to get more familiar with Python (after almost twenty years of not using it).</p>
<p>I started off trying to implement this like a Linux veteran would, as a basic CLI program. Nonetheless I switched over to Jupyter as it looks like part of building models is analyzing plots and that’s not going to go well on a CLI. And, so I’m not swimming upstream so much.</p>
<p>Per an idea from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/27/wordcamp-llms/">Making Large Language Models work for you</a>, I’m frequently using ChatGPT to quickly understand the PyTorch neural network APIs in context. Normally, I’d go on a time-consuming side-quest getting up to speed on an unfamiliar ecosystem. ChatGPT is reducing that from hours and possibly a blocker to a few minutes. Highly recommend reading those slides and trying a few of the ideas in your daily work.</p>

			 <p>I dropped in on historic races (the newest cars were 30 years old) at Laguna Seca. It’s great to see the track at scale, not as video-game or television camera angle. I watched practice sessions from the grand stand, heard the and watched the cars rip by at competitive speeds.</p>

			 <p>I’m reflecting<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> on travelogue’ing my <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/07/30/rule-is-you.html">recent</a> <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/07/31/rule-is-you.html">trip</a> <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/08/01/wherein-favorite-franchises.html">to</a> <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/08/02/many-parts-of.html">Disneyland</a>. In particular, that it was effective at taking my mind off work while maintaining creative writing and publishing habits.</p>
<p>Lately, I find myself dwelling on work too much or noodling through various puzzles I’m trying to solve. I would rather not bring that with me on vacation. What I removed and what I replaced those thoughts with went pretty well! For my own memory, and perhaps dear reader’s benefit:</p>
<p><strong>Allow plenty of moments to just exist</strong>. Listen, enjoy where you are. Engage with the folks you’re vacationing with, presuming they’re not in a phone-bubble. Try to put the phone away after you mindlessly open it out of boredom. Cultivate the moments of boredom, if you can.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t look at feeds</strong> like Slack, Discord, socials, etc. I took the extra step of removing Slack from my phone entirely. It’s easier to remove it entirely and re-add each Slack later than to try to ignore particular instances whenever I find myself mindlessly opening the app. Read a lot, ideally longer form things chosen beforehand. Again: ignore the feeds of people hustling or trying to get their ideas into my attention. Think your own thoughts!</p>
<p><strong>Replace all those feeds and work-think with written and photographic journaling.</strong> Look for photography opportunities, even if you’re not particularly good at it (yet). Write in a journal, daily, even if you’re not good at it (yet). Write about what you’ve photographed, about whatever you’re thinking while disconnected, about that conversation you just had or the novel thing you just saw/did.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to share via social networks, do it once a day.</strong> I posted (via micro.blog and <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a>) a short reflection on each day. For texture, I included a quad of photos, and wrote a few sentences to reflect on my photography or day so far. Once the post is made, put the computer away and get back to reveling in disconnection.</p>
<p>YMMV, but I hope you try it!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This constant flipping is a self-inflicted cognitive load that reduces our productivity. Pay attention to what’s happening in your mind when you flip things around. What was the CSS property I was trying to modify? Flip… flip… What was that JSON structure look like again? Flip… flip… Is it similar to Figma now? Flip… flip… When you catch yourself doing this, stop. Put them side-by-side.</p>

<p>Many of the tasks we have as software engineer is crunching information from one medium to another. What I’d like you to try instead is to pause and make all the information you need to execute your task visible on your screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using splits in my editor (vim, then <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a>), notes app (<a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>), and even window manager (<a href="https://rectangleapp.com/pro">Rectangle Pro</a>) are crucial to how I work. Single window, uni-tasking, “focus modes” were coolr in their day. But, most work lends itself to some manner of multi-window, conceptual layout. As Wisen points out, that could be test and production code, designs and code, code and browser/simulator, designs and documentation, or a document and video chat.</p>
<p>I wish I could get even <em>more</em> conceptual layout. I usually do fine with 2-3 vertical splits (i.e. three full-height windows) when I’m coding. But, I look with envy upon designers in Figma/Sketch/etc. when they consider several iterations upon one screen or lay designs out on their canvas to match the spatial/workflow relationships in the actual product. Concepts like <a href="https://natto.dev">Natto</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PureData</a>, and <a href="https://obsidian.md/canvas">Obsidian’s canvas</a> leave me optimistic that in the future I’ll find myself organizing modules and functions however I want, regardless of linear text in source code files on disk.</p>

<p>The whole magic &amp; AI thing. The most 2023 of vibes!</p>
<p>Yet, it remains to be seen to what extent AI will yield entirely new media, modalities, and consumption levels or if it will merely modify technology we’re already familiar with.</p>
<p>Is generative AI the iPhone (entirely new media/modality/consumption), the iPhone camera (displaces <em>and exceeds</em> existing categories), or the ability to scan QR codes with your camera to reduce transactional friction (a game changer for some that quickly fades into the background)?</p>

			 <p>The work is done, the post is published, the code has shipped, the boxes are all checked.</p>
<p>And yet, it remains in my head. The bit of code I’d like to revisit, an edge I couldn’t round off, a paragraph that doesn’t fit like I want it to, a workflow we didn’t improve upon, a conversation about trade-offs that went sideways…</p>
<p>The work is more than the work, more than an end. It’s emotions and memories. A new way of thinking, experience and wisdom newly integrated with what I’ve done before. The start of something new, with this finished work as the prologue that sets the stage for the next story.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Often, things are only getting started when I check that box.</p>
<p>We call it perfectionism when we hold the work back to make one last tweak, another small improvement. Perfectionism is pouring myself into one checkbox for weeks or months at the expense of all the other things I want to do. It’s not so much seeking perfect, but an inability to let go and get started in earnest.</p>
<p>To the contrary, every day I’m more convinced that perfect emerges from checking that first box. Putting the work out there, starting the next checkbox (of several dozen), accumulating and shaping something more perfect.</p>

			 <p>Before spinning up a whole Swift project, use Swift Playgrounds to sketch out ideas.</p>
<p>In Xcode (macOS):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>File -&gt; New -&gt; Playground</code></li>
<li>Choose &ldquo;Single View&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m not sure what impact picking macOS or iOS has)</li>
<li>Choose a name and location to save your playground</li>
</ul>
<p>UIKit is the iOS default for a single-view playground. Storybooks are the default for macOS. To replace those with a SwiftUI component:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span style="color:#66d9ef">import</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">SwiftUI</span>

<span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">ContentView</span>: View {
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> body: some View {
    VStack {
      Button(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Tap me!&#34;</span>) {

    }
  }
}

<span style="color:#66d9ef">let</span> contentView = ContentView()
PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(contentView)
</code></pre></div><p>🤔 I haven&rsquo;t yet come upon a good heuristic for:</p>
<ul>
<li>when to spin up a project for tinkering vs. a playground</li>
<li>to what extent one could use TDD in playgrounds</li>
<li>how to import files from a playground inside a project and use project resources</li>

The hack is that &ldquo;the page&rdquo; is often a personal journal (I use <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a>), a paper notebook (<a href="https://baronfig.com/products/confidant-hardcover-notebook">Baron Fig</a>, currently) , or even a task with a note of a few sentences in <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>. It all counts.</p>

<p>More importantly, it generates momentum. Possibly, this writer’s most crucial but immeasurable input commodity.</p>

			 <p>I’m <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2022/11/09/currently-digging.html">still</a> reading about the Manhattan Project. The going is slow. Big books, big timelines. At least, for the speed at which I read.</p>
<p>Rhodes, <em>Making of the Atomic Bomb</em> – I’m 500+ pages in and only up to the early 1940s. That’s a hefty history meatball. That said, it’s a deep dive into the history of science in context with chemistry and quantum/nuclear physics. If you like a hefty but complete book, this one is your jam.</p>
<p>Wellerstein, <em>Restricted Data</em> – I have very much enjoyed the author’s <a href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com">blog of the same name</a> over the years. The author goes deep on the newly created apparatus for keeping the Manhattan Project secret from very nearly the whole world during the war. The pace for this one is a little off, to my preference, so I’ve put this one down for the moment.</p>
<p>Gleick, <em>Genius</em> – Big Richard Feynman fan here. This book does not disappoint as a biography. Gleick is a great writer, writing with detail but without losing pace or going so deep that the thread is easily lost.</p>
<p>Reading in <a href="https://www.driverlesscrocodile.com/books-and-recommendations/more-from-tyler-cowen-and-russ-roberts-on-reading/">topical clusters</a> has worked really well for me. The books <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/02/13/on-reading-more-than-one-book-at-a-time/">talk to each</a> other. It’s a bit like a Manhattan Project Cinematic Universe when personalities come together in Los Alamos and then disperse as each book follows a different thread of history. Physicists assemble, I suppose!</p>

<li>Bed nap</li>
<li>Sky nap (airplane)</li>
<li>Train nap</li>
<li>Car nap</li>

<p>Places I have napped, for better or worse, and would not recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rock concert (The Who, Bruce Springsteen)</li>
<li>A college lecture</li>
<li>A piano recital</li>

<p>Nothing, nothing, nothing makеs me happy</p>
<p>Nothing brings me nothing but joy</p>

<p>— C. Fischoeder, <em>Bob&rsquo;s Burgers</em></p>

<p>On minor funks, needing a reset, and indeed doing nothing.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Reset</strong>. Occasionally, the things I do stop <em>doing</em> it for me. Games, shows, books, magazines, etc. I pick them up and realize I’m bored with all of them. I require a break from my breaks.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, taking a vacation or extended weekend with too little purpose <em>or</em> purpose too close to routine seems to generate the same response.</p>
<p><strong>The Reset</strong> almost always involves going offline, to some extent. Not like <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/150/">Craig Mod hiking</a> <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/116/">through rural Japan</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It sometimes involves catching up on chores, tidying up the house, or <em>extremely</em> low-key home improvement<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Related: YouTube could use a function for this. “All my subscriptions &amp; recommendations aren’t doing it, we need to go weirder/normal-er”.</p>
<p>Doing <em>absolutely</em> nothing is an option, but ends up feeling a little more hollow than free-ing.</p>
<p>More often, rebelling against my routines and script-following tendencies works. Binge-watching, grinding a game, ignoring diet, etc. sometimes get me clear.</p>
<hr>
<p>The trickiest bit is when I’m in <strong>An Indefinite Funk</strong>. Hobbies seem shallow or meant to impress others or not fulfilling anymore or too much like work or too expensive/intensive to maintain.</p>
<p>So far, I don’t have a great antidote for that. Last time it happened to me, I reverted two decades to making music, decided it still wasn’t <em>for</em> me, and went back to enjoying and sometimes studying/pontificating on music.</p>
<p>Going offline is in some ways a luxurious and nice way to reset. We so rarely allow ourselves a moment or location of offline-ness. If you have to book a flight or <a href="https://www.996roadtrip.com">outfit your Porsche 911 for camping</a>, so be it. It’s fine to just put your online devices in another room, too.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Recommended</em>: do yourself an <strong>Ideal Weekend</strong> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get coffee</li>
<li>Go for a walk in a nice park</li>
<li>Take a nap</li>
<li>Read a book</li>
<li>Go for a swim</li>
<li>Stroll through the vibrant part of your town</li>
</ul>
<p>Any weekend that includes most of those is likely to give me a reset such that any funk that is imminent or currently occurring goes away.</p>

			 <p>A few years ago, I set up a Mastodon account on a now-defunct instance. It didn’t scare me away, is kinda neat in some ways, the Bird has gone chaotic, and so I’m at it again. Like many folks the past few days, I’m setting up a Mastodon presence mostly from scratch.</p>
<p>If you’re on the fence about Mastodon, here’s how to speed-run it:</p>
<ul>
<li>skim <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/5/mastodon/">Simon Willison’s post</a> and follow as many links as you like</li>
<li>find an instance (i.e. a community/<a href="https://twitter.com/garius/status/1588827788261601280">home-room</a>) that suits you and join it</li>
<li>use <a href="https://pruvisto.org/debirdify/">Debirdify</a> to find and follow folks who have advertised a Mastodon presence</li>
<li>start posting to Mastodon; ideally, get as weird as your web presence was before global social networks were a thing</li>
</ul>
<p>This brings my web presence to at least four interesting locales. Which raises the question, “hey Adam, why do you have so many websites”. Herein, I will answer that with the question they’re intended to answer 🧠 👴🏻:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://therealadam.com">My original-ish blog</a> (<a href="https://therealadam.com/feed/">RSS</a>), answering “hey Adam, what are you thinking about or building?”</li>
<li><a href="https://short.therealadam.com">This blog</a> (<a href="https://short.therealadam.com/feed.xml">RSS</a>, <a href="https://micro.blog/adam@short.therealadam.com">@adam@short.therealadam.com</a>), answering “hey Adam, what’s currently intriguing you?”</li>
<li><a href="https://ruby.social/web/@therealadam">Mastodon</a> (<a href="%20https://ruby.social/@therealadam.rss">RSS</a>, @therealadam@ruby.social), answering “hey Adam, tell me your best one-liners and weirdest hot-takes?”</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/therealadam">Twitter</a>, answering “hey Adam, what are you thinking about, but in a punchier format?”</li>

			 <p><a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/the-art-of-sketching-strategies-for-getting-started/">The Art of Sketching: Strategies for Getting Started</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edouard Manet, the French modernist painter, once gave a still-life painting lesson to another French impressionist, Eva Gonzales. His directions for capturing the moment could be taken as instruction for sketching in any creative discipline; “Get it down quickly. Don’t worry about the background. Just go for the tonal values. See?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s about making music (ostensibly with Ableton), but applies to any creative endeavor. Coding, writing, whatever!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sketching with regularity can help you let go of the pressure of perfectionism, and arrive at a place of more casual creativity. Simply start, then sift through your sketches to find the gems later. Raúl Sotomayor has found that aiming for quantity tends to result in quality ideas to build from; “I used to make a beat every morning, spending 10 minutes to an hour, and then go on with my day. That was really helpful, because at the end of a week, I&rsquo;ll have seven beats and most of the time, at least one of them would be useful.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a creative principle, “quantity creates quality” has served me well over the past several years. You can’t create quality if you don’t have 1) a starting point and 2) freedom to throw away the lowest quality 90% of the work!</p>

			 <p>This is a story about a tiny toy table. Well, a couple of them.</p>
<p>Courtney and I play pub quiz, a lot. We play with a regular group of people at a couple of venues across town. We aim to take a “podium place” home. We come up with a fresh, topical team name every week. We are a bit competitive. It’s a thing.</p>
<p>One of our team rules is: avoid second-guessing ourselves<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The first reasonably confident person to provide the answer to our “quiz scribe” holds sway. Typically, they’re right or confident enough that no further discussion is needed and the answer is scribed to the answer sheet. A terrible way to run a company or government, but an okay way to run a quiz team.</p>
<p>Occasionally, it happens, during a quiz, that two folks will feel that the answer to a question <em>must</em> or <em>must not</em> be something. For instance, there are very frequently questions on the numerically outstanding planets in our solar system. It’s almost always Jupiter or Saturn, but it’s hard to say which. “It’s Jupiter because it has a ton of moons” or “it <em>can’t</em> be Jupiter because Saturn has even more moons”! Well, given the no-second-guessing rule, now we have a pickle. Two conflicting answers, or a non-answer, and what to do about it?</p>
<p>Regardless of how we arrive at it, we can only write one answer. This leaves the door open for us to <em>have</em> the right answer, but <em>write down</em> the wrong answer. Little indignations in jest. We are a bit competitive.</p>
<h2 id="enter-the-flipping-table">Enter the flipping table</h2>
<p>Possibly, you’ve seen the table-flip “emoji”: (┛◉Д◉)┛彡┻━┻. It’s a shorthand for “this makes me have a big, not-good feeling” in online conversation. If not, here’s the late, great Alan Rickman “performing it”:</p>
<p><img src="https://short.therealadam.com/uploads/2022/2c7201e19d.gif" alt="Alan Rickman turning a table over"></p>
<p>That’s how it feels when you suggested the right answer and your quiz team went with the wrong answer anyway. <em>Actually</em> flipping tables would get us kicked out and banned from the venues we frequent, so that’s not an option. However, it happens, tables come in <em>all</em> sizes. Including, very tiny simulacrum of tables.</p>
<p><img src="https://short.therealadam.com/uploads/2022/1d12a90c23.png" alt="This is a toy, not an actual dining set"></p>
<p>So one night after quiz, I scoured the internet for tiny tables that we could flip. Once I dialed in the search (there are many ways to search for “toy table” on Amazon that will not yield tables that are toys or tables that are flippable amongst polite company), a table was ordered. A few days later, thanks to the magic of just-in-time supply chain logistics<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, we had a toy table. So it came that every night, as we were preparing for the quiz, we set out our little (toy) table on top of the (actual) table in case there was a moment of indignation.</p>
<h2 id="our-reputation-precedes-us">Our reputation precedes us</h2>
<p>Turns out, flipping a tiny table with your finger is pretty cathartic. The tiny table got a lot of use. We really liked our tiny table.</p>
<p>Even better, a table of adults with a tiny toy table in the center of them is a curious thing. Other teams and quiz hosts inquired about our table. We explained it, let them flip the table. People liked it.</p>
<p>Word of our flipping table spread amongst the Austin pub-quiz community. When new hosts would fill in for our normal quiz host, they would introduce themselves and ask to see our flipping table.</p>
<p>Our reputation for flipping tables preceded us. One could have a worse reputation!</p>
<h2 id="epilogue-for-a-tiny-toy-table">Epilogue for a tiny toy table</h2>
<p>As is common of tiny toys delivered by a logistics machine optimized for low cost, the flipping table was not particularly strong. Eventually, we lost or broke it, I don’t remember which.</p>
<p>In any case, a second, slightly larger and fancier flipping table was provisioned. This one even had place settings. Fast-forward a few months, it too broke. One of our quiz teammates took it upon themselves to <em>repair</em> said table. At this point, we had a very robust flipping table, and <em>some</em> of its place settings remaining.</p>
<p>Sadly, our regular quizzing was curtailed by the pandemic, shutting down basically all bars wherein one would play pub quiz. I’m not sure where the flipping table ended up; we haven’t used it in the year since we started quizzing again.</p>
<p>But those months we had a flipping table; glory days!</p>

			 <p>I jumped into a short <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1561504734892023808">un-conference organized/hosted by Andy Matuschak</a> last weekend. Within this humble Gather, I came across lots of intriguing people and energizing ideas. Some notes and a few follow-up ideas:</p>
<p><img src="https://short.therealadam.com/uploads/2022/e1baddc3b8.png" alt="My notes from the event"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.napkin.one">Napkin</a> is <em>space</em> for ideas and not, it seems, about note capture as an end. Rather, it&rsquo;s about throwing ideas or quotes at the (metaphorical) wall and letting the system organize them into clusters or connections. If you like some of those idea, you organize the ideas into a linear outline and export that to whatever you like to write with.</p>
<p><a href="https://ncase.me/nutshell/">Nutshell</a> is about adding an extra dimension to documents on the web. The creator, <a href="https://ncase.me">Nicky Case</a>, described it as a &ldquo;tool for expandable explanation&rdquo;. Those explanations take the form of popovers that may contain a bit of text (like a footnote/annotation), a scraped reference to another page (transclusion), or a fully interactive gizmo to explore an idea in a more tactile manner.</p>
<p>Excitement about applying language models (e.g. GPT-3 or DALL-E) to generative creativity came up a few times. Some of the applications demoed were already using language models to augment insight or obviate manual human organization. Using models to &lsquo;read between the lines&rsquo; of captured notes/human input and generate new ideas came up as well.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with some current PKM tools came up a couple times. In particular, seeking note capture or memory recall as a (customer) engagement end rather than as a means to thinking more/better thoughts. I <em>think</em> I heard a couple criticisms that some tool was &ldquo;too IT&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m not sure I even heard it correctly or what that would even mean! 😆</p>
<p>Overall: highly recommend seeking folks using computers to augment their ability to create and remember instead of stopping at “finally got my notes app just the way I like it”!</p>

			 <p>About a year ago, I added a curiously pretentious object to my repertoire of productivity hacks. <a href="https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog">Analog</a> is a) a paper productivity notation not unlike Bullet Journaling b) printed on pleasantly thick index cards and c) a bit of desk furniture to prop up the cards and store the last couple dozen of them.</p>
<p>The idea is you write your tasks down for today/later/someday. Those tasks sit right in front of you, taunting you. You cross them off as you get stuff done. Now you’ve done a productivity!</p>
<p>Reductionist jokes aside, it’s a fine system. The cards are printed with “Today”, “Next”, or “Someday” at the top and lines to encourage writing down several, but not too many, tasks. It’s a good way to think about organizing what you need/want to get done. As productivity systems go, it’s clear and non-invasive<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/02/one-month-on-analog/">Dave Rupert uses/tried Analog</a> too and has a good take on it.</p>
<p>Tactility is Analog’s leg up. It’s nice to start the day writing out some tasks, looking over the previous day’s cards, shuffling the cards from previous days. Even <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things, the best task software</a>, can’t provide the tactile “ahhhh”-moment of crossing an item off your list. Tasteful animation, design, and haptics get close, but touching glass isn’t as good as pen and paper.</p>
<p>That said, I’m not tempted to discard Things. It’s literally one of the best applications I’ve used, ever. That said, it’s charming to have a redundant, back-up scheme for reminding myself of the most important things to accomplish today. Analog is like having a (very handsome) back-up alarm clock to the alarm clock one <em>intends</em> to wake up to. It’s always pleasant to look at, and every so often it is the difference between an energetic day and a day played catching up.</p>

			 <p>This ended up covering late Davis stuff. He’s basically inventing a new genre of jazz every album or two now.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>On the Corner</em>: Davis invents funk/soul jazz.</li>
<li><em>A Tribute to Jack Johnson</em>: Davis invents rock/jazz fusion.</li>
<li><em>Tutu</em>: Davis invents synth-jazz/the thing that would get distilled and warped down to New Age/Kenny G jazz in the 90s.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous live albums! I didn’t go down the rabbit hole on this part. <em>Miles and Quincy Live at Montreux</em> features Quincy Jones and is a pretty great end-of-career retrospective.</p>
<p>“Willie Nelson” on <em>Directions</em> is surprisingly funky.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall, I could have gone for less <em>Birth of the Cool</em>-esque and more <em>Bitches Brew</em>. 🤷I like bop, but funk and fusion are more legible to my modest jazz-harmony ear.</p>
<p>Highlights: <em>On the Corner</em>, <em>Jack Johnson</em>, <em>Tutu</em>. The last was originally planned as a Miles Davis/Prince collaboration (❗ ❗ ❗) which fell through. Still pretty good.</p>
<p>What I’d hoped to get out of this, and indeed did, was hearing the invention of large swaths of the jazz landscape over time, album by album. In this way, Miles Davis was a singular influence on the course of music, a lot like Beethoven was.</p>
<p>Hopefully, in my lifetime, we’ll realize another musician has come around and broadly invented entire genres of music every few albums. (I’m assuming we’ll still have albums!)</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The good news is that you can! The bad news is that you shouldn’t. At least not directly on your team’s codebase and not on any critical path work.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Good ideas therein! Let me emphasize one I’m particularly fond of.</p>
<p>In my first engineering management role, I had the opportunity to go completely hands off. For a while, I found it a little off-putting. I really like solving problems with code! (I later realized leadership and management are solving problems <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with people<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but that’s for another time.)</p>
<p>I felt a lot better about engineering management once I figured out it gave me license to code on impractical things. When you’re an EM (the hands-off variety, not the sitting-on-the-fence variety), you have the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->opportunity<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to code on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->whatever draws your interest<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, knowing it won’t block your team.</p>
<p>That’s a pretty rad opportunity for someone like me who’s a bit of an esoteric tinkerer.</p>
<p>If you’re less of a tinkerer and more of a shipper or solver, even the highest functioning teams have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pile of ambitions and ideas they aren’t actively pursuing. An engineering manager can explore the frontiers on these ideas. Maybe a plan is made, research is noted, or its found the idea isn’t all that great after all. Still a win!</p>
<p>As long as your code doesn’t create challenges or blockers for your organization: dive into it, have fun, explore the space!</p>

			 <p>I saw this local band Adam’s Farm (no relation, promise) a few times when I was 15 or so. In the era of mixing bass guitar <em>out</em> of rock music (no thanks, Metallica), these fellows stood out by being having an EP where I could clearly hear <em>all</em> the instruments. It was almost 25 years later that I’d learn that “Girlfriend” in particular is a Modern Lovers cover.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sidenote: it seemed like this local band was lost to the internet until recently as well. I figured I’d ripped one of the only copies of this CD, but Adam’s Farm music appeared on YouTube recently. Fancy that!</p>
<p>William Shatner’s cover of “Common People” is less difficult to find, but possibly equally obscure. Back in the late ’90s, Shatner did some voice overs on a Ben Folds pre-solo album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_Pop"><em>Fear of Pop</em></a>. In the mid ‘00s, Folds produced William Shatner’s album of songs with tons of guests doing the singing and Shatner mostly <em>talking</em> about mortality and aging. Again, it was several years before I heard the original of “Common People”.</p>

			 <p>The modern marvel that moves commodities, sub-assemblies, finished product, and people across the planet is largely invisible. Except when I’m bumped from an overbooked flight. Or when I can’t buy your favorite kind of candy because the trucks to move the containers from the ships to the stores are in the wrong place. Or when one can’t build a car in Germany because semiconductor fabrication plants aren’t as elastic as some executive thought they were. Then it becomes all too apparent that the default state of transportation is, absent considerable effort and coordination, for the wheels to fly off constantly.</p>
<p>Hence, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PHmYhE4sKnwzYgvkh/a-brief-introduction-to-container-logistics">A Brief Introduction to Container Logistics</a> is a great primer for understanding the weird state of our world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole shipping process involves dozens of actors, from the exporter, through a long chain of companies who handle the container (incurring costs on behalf of the shipment), all the way to the importer. This creates a trust problem: who is responsible for the problems that arise when one part of this chain goes wrong? Some of these companies are hired by the shipping company, others by the exporter or importer, or even by a logistics company acting as a middle man. This is usually solved by some kind of chain of custody, where any problem with the container must be immediately noted and complained about by the relevant party.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Supply chains are a new class of engineered-emergent artifact, one that includes a few other globe-spanning things like the internet, the air travel system, and low earth orbit, that exist at a level of Gaian phenomenology, terraforming, and planet-scale husbandry. We only ever catch local glimpses of these things. The wholes are too big to fit in a single human mind, and the physical embodiments are too vast to capture even on a single map, let alone in a single photograph.</p>
<p>We have to understand these beasts, in all their evolving, learning glory, while living within their bellies. Abstract slicing and dicing of the phenomenology, via aspects like computation, circularity, and situatedness, can only get us so far. To finish the picture, we have to develop a sensitivity to how we inhabit these beasts at a human scale.</p>

<p>To accompany the National Symphony Orchestra’s Beethoven &amp; American Masters concert series, author and illustrator Mo Willems presents Beethoven Symphonies Abstracted, an exhibition of nine large-scale, painted abstractions inspired by the music and genius of Beethoven. Each large-scale work is a response to one of Beethoven’s nine symphonies, divided into panels that visually interpret each symphonic movement.</p>

			 <p>Fancy some near-term imagination on the opportunities the re-commercialization of space presents us? Yes, have some! <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/11/17/science-upside-for-starship/">Science upside for Starship</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is, however, a fun exercise to enumerate all the ways in which Starship and related technologies can help execute bold, ambitious missions of scientific discovery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Giant, poly-lithic space telescopes? Sure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably the coolest telescope concept enabled by Starship, though, is the giant segmented telescope to end all giant segmented telescopes. An unmodified Starship can deliver perhaps a dozen 8 m monolithic hexagonal free-flying segments per launch to a target location such as L2, where they self assemble, calibrate, and then focus incoming light. Over a few dozen Starship flights, a truly enormous spherical mirror section perhaps 1000 m in diameter and with a focal length of 1000 km or so can be assembled behind a free-flying sun shade, pointed in a direction of general interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heating (low-key terraforming) Mars with constellations of mirrors? Okay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second is mass producing light sails on Earth, launching them into LEO, then flying them to Mars where they can lurk near Mars-Sun L2 and reflect light back at the planet, reducing heat loss during the Martian night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Flood the zone” of our planetary neighbors with exploratory robots? As you wish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why shouldn’t we have a dedicated orbiter, lander, rover, helicopter, and submarine on every discrete body in the solar system over, say, 100 km in diameter? Let’s build a fleet of clockwork automatons for Venus and an armada of submarines for Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. Let’s darken the Martian skies with helicopters. Let’s drive rovers across the frozen nitrogen plains of Pluto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sure it’s a lot more complicated than it sounds from these pull-quotes. I’ll bet that SpaceX’s starship won’t meet some of these expectations. We will have to hold our nose or plug our ears as Musk bloviates. Despite all that, it’s exciting that folks are thinking, writing, and blogging about this and <em>some</em> of it could come to fruition in my lifetime!</p>

<p>Favorite tracks: “Suck My Kiss”, “Sir Psychosexy”, “Power of Equality”, “The Righteous &amp; the Wicked”.</p>
<p>The essential (in my opinion) Red Hot Chili Peppers album is, for me, a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the first albums I heard with good bass playing (I ‘grew up’ in the age after Metallica had mixed bass guitar entirely out of their albums and many others followed suit)</li>
<li>One of the first albums I heard that was <em>great</em> from end to end and where many of the songs flowed into each other as if played live, meant to fit together, or like they weren’t even separate songs</li>
<li>Extremely teenage and horny, of which I was both when I first heard it</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s an album that has aged well for me. It was an excellent album when I first heard it, and is <em>still</em> an excellent album when I listen to it today.</p>
<p>There are other nice qualities too: Rick Rubin’s production work. When it’s not extremely horny, it has some good lyrics. It’s rooted in the RHCP musical predecessors with intelligent awareness, not than blind copying. They are seeing further by standing on the shoulders of George Clinton, not just sitting on his shoulders for a free ride. It’s just good funk.</p>
<p>And yes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnvpU0d7vyM">the RHCP joke in <em>The Good Place</em> is superb</a>.</p>

<p><em>Summer of Soul</em> - Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone. Heck yes.</p>
<p><em>Dune</em> - loved the world building here and I’m willing to look past the decision to split this into two movies.</p>
<p><em>Somewhere You Feel Free</em> - I didn’t realize <em>Wildflowers</em> was so pivotal for Tom Petty. Made me want to get in my car and listen to the whole thing, which I did and greatly enjoyed.</p>

<p><em>Only Murders in the Building</em> - is there a greater showbiz duo than Martin Short and Steve Martin?</p>
<p><em>Hacks</em> - inside baseball on standup comedy plus Jean Smart is 👨‍🍳</p>
<p><em>What We Do in the Shadows</em> - a mockumentary sitcom expanding its world, taking chances with changing things up, and absolutely nailing the landing.</p>
<h2 id="albums">Albums</h2>
<p>Funkadelic, <em>Maggot Brain</em> - hits more emotional points than I’d ever expect from a George Clinton thing.</p>
<p>Miles Davis, <em>Sketches of Spain</em> - nudging into Very Intellectual, nearly classical, jazz, Davis is at least as good as Mingus was at this.</p>
<p>Prince, <em>Welcome 2 America</em> - recorded ten years ago, but it absolutely works today.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>Neal Stephenson, <em>Cryptonomicon</em> - I finished re-reading the whole Baroque Trilogy plus this one and they surpassed my recollection of how good they are.</p>

			 <p>Kevin Kelly, <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/the-third-way/">The Third Way</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Huge monopolistic companies running platforms like Facebook and Amazon are not mere corporations, nor are they governments, even though they have many of the attributes of both government and corporations. They are a new third thing: platforms. We should not expect to regulate platforms like companies, nor expect them to behave like governments. We need a third category of rights and responsibilities for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Platform-principalities. Bank-states (which, oddly enough, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggUduBmvQ_4">includes airlines</a>). Energy-sovereigns (British Petroleum, Exxon). Media-empires (Disney, Universal).</p>
<p>We require a better term for companies that have grown so extraordinarily. Those like Apple that run international diplomacy programs with China. Those like Amazon or Google, that regard their employees as de-facto citizens. Those like airlines that can print a currency (in the form of loyalty programs).</p>
<p>And, as Kelly notes, we should look at them in an entirely different way. We shouldn’t treat Amazon the same we treat a local retailer, just like we don’t treat your local HOA the same way we treat the European Union. “Platforms” is a good start, but a word that connects the tremendous influence modern mega-corps have with the power that Standard Oil or The British East India Corporation had at their apex would be even better!</p>

<p><em>Endtroducing</em> is my canonical example of a revealing album. I heard “Building Steam With a Grain of Sand” completely accidentally in a college business writing class, of all places. A fellow student used it in their presentation, ironically. Afterwards, I asked “what <em>was</em> that?!”, my mind still blown.</p>
<p>I downloaded it and was immediately like “wow”. A whole new angle on music became apparent. I was vaguely aware that hip-hop quotes other music, but didn’t really understand sampling. I’m <em>just</em> old enough that hip-hop has always been a thing. But this was so different, like an other-worldly quote-fest. But, in a good way. A great way, even.</p>
<p>I later learned <em>Endtroducing</em> is notable in that it was made <em>manually</em>. Ableton didn’t exist, so if you wanted to change tempos on samples, you had to pitch correct them yourself. You didn’t have to tape splice anymore, thankfully. But it was still far tricker than making this album would have been today.</p>
<p>This album would spark many musical explorations. Mash-ups like <em>A Night at the Hip-Hopera</em>. The Roots, J Dilla, Soulquarians, and a myriad of other artists. “Building Steam With a Grain of Sand” sparked amazement, curiosity, and appetite for more music I was previously unaware of.</p>

<p>These are my favorite of Beethoven’s “more approachable” symphonies. Symphony No. 9 is my favorite, but it requires a bit more context to take in. Further, it’s a solid seventy minutes of music, ramping up the difficulty of attention span.</p>
<p>Symphony No. 7 (hereafter Seven, etc.) is my favorite outside of Nine, which is sort of its own <em>pivotal</em> thing. It’s a definitive no-skip symphony. Every movement is sublime in its own way. The first movement for its vigor and speed. The second for its solemn opening that builds and builds into a big, emotional moment. The third for its frolic. The final movement for feeling several minutes of emphatic, resolving punctuation and resolution.</p>
<p>Symphony No. 8 has a wonderful opening. The structure and melodic quality is closer to what came <em>before</em> Beethoven’s Symphony No. 1. It sounds like a nod back to Haydn or Mozart, Beethoven’s predecessors. But the harmony and orchestration is distinctly of Beethoven. It’s a great bridge from Beethoven’s Very Good symphonies to his <em>Amazing Symphony Number 9, The One with Ode to Joy</em> (not the official title as recognized by music historians).</p>
<p>These two symphonies fit together <em>really well</em> on CDs. So, you can find basically any conductor/ensemble you prefer performing it. I listened to the Karajan/Berlin Philharmonic version when I was playing music in high school. I’ve found this piece easy to hear little variations between conductors, so if that’s your thing, queue up a few interpretations and go hunting for little distinctions!</p>

			 <p>There are four-ish kinds of great albums, in my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pivotal albums: the artist or genre was distinctly different before and after the album came out. e.g., classical music was distinctly different after Beethoven, particularly <em>Symphony No. 9</em></li>
<li>Revealing albums: pivotal to my perspective or knowledge of music. e.g., my understanding of hip-hop was distinctly different after I heard DJ Shadow’s <em>Endtroducing</em></li>
<li>Consistent albums: no track justifies skipping, you can listen to the thing end to end, every time. e.g., Tom Petty’s <em>The Last DJ</em></li>
<li>Under-rated albums: albums that are outshined by their extraordinary peers or contemporaries. Most folks know that <em>Born to Run</em> is great, and all other Springsteen albums (generally) rank below it. But that shouldn’t let otherwise excellent and out-of-sequence later albums like <em>The Rising</em> or <em>Human Touch</em> go unnoticed.</li>

			 <p>I’m kicking off a new “listening project” - Miles Davis. Inspired by <a href="https://samenright.com/2021/06/06/a-beginners-guide-to-miles-davis/">A Beginner’s Guide to Miles Davis</a>, I’m going to grind my way through the Miles-verse in chronological order. For posterity, my favorites from before this journey are <em>Sketches of Spain</em> and <em>Bitches Brew</em>.</p>
<p>(I think <em>Kind of Blue</em> is properly rated but not noteworthy because it’s the jazz album that everyone knows and reveres, whether they like jazz or not. And, rightly so.)</p>
<p>Previously in listening projects:</p>
<p>Circa 2008, I got a little bored/annoyed with what I was listening to and decided to play through all the songs in my iTunes library, in order by artist. Discoveries (to me) lurking therein: Bruce Springsteen <em>Born to Run</em>, Talking Heads, <em>Stop Making Sense</em>. Getting through the B-artists was a real endeavor. I have a <em>lot</em> of Ben Folds, Beethoven, Billy Joel, and Brahms albums.</p>
<p>Circa 2016, I listened to all of the Radiohead albums in chronological order. I’d previously really only known them as “the Creep guys” and “the dudes who released an album of MP3s way before everyone else”. (But probably not before Prince, who also performed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAzzRQe6lms">“Creep”</a>, eventually.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to the OPC series of CPUs, where everything fits on one page - one page each for specification, emulation, HDL. For details see the OPC Project web pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Computer architecture, Verilog code to implement the design, simulation and testing of the design, writing an assembler and assembly to test the system. All within my favorite kind of constraint - fitting each component on one page.</p>
<p>They’re not particularly useful machines, but they do de-mystify the bridge from electrical engineering to software engineering.</p>
<p>When I was an intern at Texas Instruments, the tools for this were enormously complex, slow, and expensive. Whole clusters of Sun machines set aside for simulating the upcoming designs and verifying they did the right thing in software. Not to mention the tremendous effort of verifying the design that was coded was possible to build in the company’s chip fabrication plants and processes.</p>
<p>That this depth of tooling is now available to hobbyists would have blown me away in 2002.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s hard to land music, books, etc. recommendations from friends because timing is everything. The best case is a recommendation for a thing I didn&rsquo;t know of and it&rsquo;s <em>precisely</em> what I need to read or watch at the exact moment. Beyond that, it&rsquo;s likely I&rsquo;m reading some 900-page book (humble-brag) or deep into a peak television series (humble-brag) that I&rsquo;m trying to finish before my attention wanders.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come up with a couple of ways to more immediately act on recommendations, so they aren&rsquo;t for naught:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download a Kindle/iBooks sample right away and read the first several pages of whatever they recommended. If I&rsquo;m into it maybe I&rsquo;ll stick with it. At least, it&rsquo;s on my backlog of books until I forgot why it&rsquo;s there and delete it (i.e., 2-3 times a decade).</li>
<li>Watch the first several minutes of the thing on Netflix or whatever. See if it&rsquo;s any good instead of watching random YouTube videos recommended by the algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p>For everything else, there&rsquo;s always the long, scary list of things I&rsquo;d read/watch/play/listen to if we stopped doing billionaires and gave everyone a living wage. 🤷‍♂️</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Replicache runs alongside your existing application infrastructure. You keep your existing server-side stack and client-side frameworks. Replicache doesn&rsquo;t take ownership of data, and is not the source of truth. Its job is to provide bidirectional sync between your clients and your servers. This makes it easy to adopt: you can try it for just a small piece of functionality, or a small slice of users, while leaving the rest of your application the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Conflicts are a fact of life when syncing, but they don&rsquo;t have to be painful. Replicache rewinds and replays your transactions during sync, sort of like git rebase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used Replicache, but this design document makes me think it has the qualities that excite me when I discover infrastructural software:</p>
<ul>
<li>it solves a tricky problem (distributed application state)</li>
<li>by compressing the problem down to essential concepts</li>
<li>those concepts are solved in a way that I can imagine &ldquo;how would I use this?&rdquo;</li>
<li>and writing clearly about that solution</li>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve got three &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; desktops going on my Mac right now. The idea each is its own functional workspace. I don&rsquo;t have three separate physical workspaces to do my writing/thinking, coding/building, or communicating/collaborating. So a digital approximation is the second closest thing. 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>Leftmost is where I do the thinking. The background is one of the &ldquo;scenic&rdquo; images included in macOS. The idea is, if I had a little writing hut, ala <a href="https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/11/06/dickinson/dickinson-thoreau.w700.h467.jpg">Thoreau in <em>Dickinson</em></a> for looking off into the distance and plying some kind of writing craft, this is the kind of thing I would see when I look up.</p>
<p>Rightmost is where I communicate with the world and my colleagues. The background is also a built-in macOS dynamic desktop of swoopy, abstract colors. Like <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/oliver-1-1024x576.jpg">John Oliver comes to our living room from a featureless void</a>, so I think of this desktop. Ideas, questions, and data points come to me from the void of the internet, end up in this imagined space, and I respond to them in turn through this medium and back to the void. Heavy, eh?</p>
<p>In the middle is where I do the building and coding. The background here is a flat color. I got it by color picking a photo of the <a href="http://www.12-gaugegarage.com">12-Gauge Garage</a>. I noticed later that it&rsquo;s close to &ldquo;<a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2021/04/disney-go-away-green-lp1/">go away green</a>&rdquo; as used in Disney&rsquo;s theme parks to draw the eye away from backstage areas where the magic may be in-progress or under-repair. The idea is I shouldn&rsquo;t really see this background. I should focus on whatever I&rsquo;m coding/testing/making/etc.</p>

<li>Seek First To Understand, Then To Be Understood. Don&rsquo;t get defensive about your point of view or perception of reality - understand theirs first. Either you will learn something new or you&rsquo;ll understand how to better get your point across. Hold multiple perspectives in your head and be able to summarize the best arguments of all major parties in a way that THEY agree with.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="15">
<li>Don&rsquo;t offer unsolicited help. Make Sure Help Is Wanted Before Offering It. Men - be especially wary about this when women are talking about their problems. Sometimes they just need support, not solutions.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="23">
<li>Separate Your Identity from Your Work. You can learn a lot on the Internet for the low, low price of $YOUR_EGO.</li>

			 <p>You can do a lot of fancy stuff with your notes these days. Backlinks, graphs, embedding, “transclusion”, knowledge databases, and digital gardens are all tempting sirens. But <strong>building up a collection of ideas over time and ease of search is the most important thing.</strong></p>
<p>Matt Webb, <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2021/02/10/reservoirs">Memexes, mountain lakes, and the serendipity of old ideas</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve noticed that smart people keep notes, and in particular use their notes in a certain way, and it made me think of something I read recently about viruses.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And it’s interesting, right, this accretive note-taking and the process of taking core samples through the deep time of your own ideas. I’ve built something similar, not as consistently, but for about two decades too, and I keep all my notes in plain text, and all in the same searchable database. I develop nascent ideas in part by typing in keywords, spelunking my own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">memex</a> for things I’ve previously spotted, connections I’ve made, turns of phrase… most of which I had forgotten, but there they are. And old ideas come back and get recombined and become fresh again. That database of notes is my greatest asset. It’s how I write here, and it’s also how I pretend to be clever when I’m working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The endgame of having extensive notes accumulated over a long period of time is not to put them in a grand, unified theory. <strong>The point is to play the long-game to think in them, search them for new insights, and to develop ideas over weeks and months. An antidote to thinking in Slack messages and tweet-storm hot-takes.</strong></p>

			 <p>How Product Hunt does asynchronous work: everyone in their own swimlane, unblocked. I really dig how they haven’t siloed work between front-end/back-end developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.rstankov.com/collaborative-single-player-mode/">Collaborative Single Player Mode</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A developer should be able to execute a feature from start to finish &ndash; from the database to the backend, API, frontend, and CSS. The goal is never to get blocked.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are missing a design, mock the UI, designers can fill this in later</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t know how to do something technically, hack it or fake it</li>
<li>If a product decision is missing, try to make this decision yourself - it&rsquo;s better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like they use feature flags so they can move quickly and decisively, but safely. And of course, plenty of testing and code review automation.</p>

<p>Growing an organization requires rethinking trust, coordination, and collaboration. The breakpoints where things go from working pretty well to an absolute shamble come faster than we think. They don’t even occur at nice, round numbers like base–2 or base–10 orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>I found that writing prose until I run out of clarity and then switching to proof-of-concept code is even better. The constraint of making an ambitious design work with a minimal change-set is a nice way to work for a day or so.</p>
<p>Lots of features or fixes don’t require in-depth thinking to get started. But when they do, sorting out the ideas and tradeoffs in writing helps a lot.</p>
<p>Write until I run out of ideas, flesh those ideas out, write about the nuances I found. It’s a nice feedback loop!</p>

<p>For most of “Starship Troopers,” humanity, in every possible facet, gets its ass kicked.

<p>The pandemic that has dominated the past three months strikes a useful contrast with what’s happening now. Unlike coronavirus, racism and police violence are problems caused by humans. There’s a saying, “You aren’t stuck in traffic, you are traffic.” Similarly, the unrest occurring right now isn’t something that is happening to anyone, but a phenomenon that everyone is a part of, even if they haven’t left home or directly participated at all. Like traffic, the reason you’re surrounded by protests is partially because of you, regardless of your perceived level of involvement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When does a platform truly &ldquo;dies&rdquo;? A &ldquo;dead language&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;a language which is no longer in everyday spoken use&rdquo;. By analogy, a dead platform would die not when it ceases to be profitable or when it is obsolete, but when people stop playing it and caring about it.</p>

			 <p>Bonus quote from <a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/01/eno/">Revenge of the Intuitive</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years ago I realized that the recording studio was becoming a musical instrument. I even lectured about it, proclaiming that “by turning sound into malleable material, studios invite you to construct new worlds of sounds as painters construct worlds of form and color.” I was thrilled at how people were using studios to make music that otherwise simply could not exist. Studios opened up possibilities. But now I’m struck by the insidious, computer-driven tendency to take things out of the domain of muscular activity and put them into the domain of mental activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am, in general, a sucker for the notion of the studio as a kind of musical instrument unto itself. It&rsquo;s a very maximalist, Romantic-era symphony sort of thinking. I want to be <em>Pet Sounds</em>-era Brian Wilson or <em>Rite of Spring</em>-era Stravinksy when I grow up.</p>

			 <p>We should use the pandemic to reevaluate how we value service, child care, and education labor. It’s apparent we undervalued them. Their value is now explicit for those clamoring for a return to paying people to handle their chores and obligations. So let’s pay them more when we emerge from this!</p>
<p>The burden of navigating urban sprawl to reach our offices, shops, and entertainment is now explicit. Density won’t be the answer for this is in the short or medium term. Perhaps we could value the ease by which we can drive around right now and work backwards from there.</p>
<p>The bit that has worried me is how density is no longer a virtue. Public transport and dense neighborhoods won’t be desirable for a while. What’s the alternative that reduces our environmental toll and increases the cohesion of our neighborhoods?</p>

<p>You could also think about the Apple Watch as the main input device. In contrast to the AirPods, Apple opened the Watch for developers from the start, but it hasn’t really seen much success as a platform. Perhaps a combination of Watch and AirPods has a better chance of creating an ecosystem with its own unique applications?</p>

			 <p>Drew Austin on high/low-brow music, how it fits into album reviews and club culture, and how all that has shifted in our current state of distance. <a href="https://kneelingbus.substack.com/p/122-energy-flash">Energy Flash</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For Reynolds, “at home and at album length” refers to a process of decontextualization, the musical equivalent of the modern gallery’s white cube: a belief that any cultural product meriting serious appreciation must prove that it can survive outside of its native habitat by becoming a fungible unit of culture, fitting into the standardized format of Pitchfork album reviews and solitary, focused listening. If music sounds good in a packed nightclub at 3 a.m. but not through headphones on your couch, is it real in the same way that Kid A is real? Right now in quarantine, the contextualizing environments in which culture traditionally incubates are closed off and dormant, so everything has to sound good in the living room whether it’s meant to or not. We live in the white cube now; anything that relies on a specific source of external context is an endangered species. We’re one month into a worldwide experiment to learn whether the internet alone can produce sufficient meaning on its own, or whether we must keep mining our memories of an embodied shared reality to bridge this gap.”</p>

<p>The aerospace giant of course wants a $60 billion bailout. Financial problems for this corporation predated the crisis, with the mismanagement that led to the 737 Max as well as defense and space products that don&rsquo;t work (I noted last July a bailout was coming). The corporation paid out $65 billion in stock buybacks and dividends over the last ten years, and it was drawing down credit lines before this crisis hit. It is highly politically connected; the board of the corporation includes Caroline Kennedy, Ronald Reagan’s Chief of Staff Ken Duberstein, three Fortune 100 CEOs, a former US Trade Representative, and two Admirals, one of whom is the board’s only engineer. Using the excuse of the coronavirus, Boeing is trying to get the taxpayer to foot the bill for its errors, so it can go back to making more of them.</p>

			 <p>I just finished reading the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Watchmen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> graphic novel and it is amazing. I was drawn in by the HBO series last year, which amplified my enjoyment of the original story. It might end up in my top five works of fiction.</p>
<p>The story is of its time: the Cold War, superheroes as saviors. Even better, it has timeless themes that feel relevant in our weird contemporary situation: growing authoritarianism and nihilism towards overcoming the status quo to tackle other looming problems.</p>
<p>I saw the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Watchmen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> movie first, several years ago. The movie, as I remember it, holds to the first few issues surprisingly well. The ending of the comic is far superior to the one used in the movie. The comic has more space to expand minor storylines and even introduce a whole other comic within the graphic novel. The comic stands head and shoulders above the movie.</p>
<p>I still feel like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Watchmen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> HBO series was one of, if not singularly, the best shows on television/streaming last year. The graphic novel is the perfect chaser. Lots of plot points make more sense through the lens of the graphic novel: the whole squid attack, Looking Glass being slightly off, Robert Redford as president.</p>
<p>If it turns out they don’t produce more seasons in the HBO series timeline, at least there will always be the comic. (And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Westworld<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for the time being).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing a thing on the skill of reading framework code.

<p>So sometimes you, the reader, will see me hastily publish something written in the second person. Sometimes I&rsquo;m diligent and search&amp;replace for &ldquo;you&rdquo;. Tools like Grammarly could probably help me here. But sometimes, I like to leave in the notes to my past or future self. 🤷‍♂️</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have locality when you don&rsquo;t have to look beyond your gaze to understand how you are affected or how you affect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find languages with a strong module system (Rust, Clojure, sometimes ES6-by-the-books) make each source file more coherent and easier to read than languages where methods or state have more sophisticated/powerful lookup schemes (Ruby, React-flavored ES6).</p>
<p>Plus, strong module systems seem to come with the side benefit of encouraging us to make up names for the functions and state we import, again improving coherence and readability.</p>
<p>A strong sense of locality, module systems, and coherence aren&rsquo;t in a causal relationship, but they sure do taste great together.</p>

			 <p>I often say that learning test-driven development is comparable to learning a whole other programming language. The practice of TDD is a mirror world of depth and trade-offs. Kent Beck underscores that depth in listing all [the desirable qualities of good tests], some of which are at tension with each other. Tests aren’t the easiest thing to get right, but there’s no better way to improve your design skills than to wrestle with the feedback loop of writing tests for the code you’re currently working on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Tetlock’s 20-year study, both the broad foxes and the narrow hedgehogs were quick to let a successful prediction reinforce their beliefs. But when an outcome took them by surprise, foxes were much more likely to adjust their ideas. Hedgehogs barely budged. Some made authoritative predictions that turned out to be wildly wrong—then updated their theories in the wrong direction. They became even more convinced of the original beliefs that had led them astray. The best forecasters, by contrast, view their own ideas as hypotheses in need of testing. If they make a bet and lose, they embrace the logic of a loss just as they would the reinforcement of a win. This is called, in a word, learning.</p>

A bunch of folks out on the internet have bravely contributed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->literally hundreds of strategies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for various services that provide OAuth2 sign-in, e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->omniauth-twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->omniauth-github<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>A nice thing about the Strategy implementation is that each phase of the OAuth2 callback scheme<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a method; you can overwrite each one to handle the particularities of the provider you’re integrating with. For example, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“callback phase”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the most common extension point since every app is likely to want to store user information and access tokens differently.</p>
<p>In the wild, OmniAuth is often used in combination with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Devise for user models<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which in turn uses <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Warden for authentication<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Also nifty to note: the Rakefile for OmniAuth has developer tasks for benchmarking performance and measuring memory overhead. It’s pretty awesome that an essential gem like this has that level of detail in its maintenance.</p>
<p>The time required to do a simplistic OAuth verification is negligible; about as fast as a call to Redis:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have no baseline to compare this with, but memory usage looks like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So that’s OmniAuth. If your Rails app is more than a few years old and integrates with other services, you’re probably already using it. Thanks, OmniAuth community!</p>

<p>News to me, Moby has been making <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extended ambient tracks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in some manner of partnership with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Calm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> app. They make good “I need to focus and get stuff done” music, but aren’t particularly high energy, if that’s your thing.

<p>I would like to some day learn enough piano to play and sing the songs of the original Van Halen line-up, e.g. &ldquo;Panama&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hot for Teacher&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beautiful Girls&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Unchained&rdquo;. My theory here is, the original Van Halen is very Vaudeville, except louder and more late-seventies. Corollary: played literally and with a little bit of a vaudevillian spin, they’d work perfectly. Case in point: &ldquo;Ice Cream Man&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>They&rsquo;re on our phones, in our voicemails. Computers or sometimes even humans calling in massive volumes, funneling people into bad purchases. Questionable insurance at best, outright fraud at worst. Sometimes, depending on the state you live in, politics!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to pick up on an unknown number in 2019, or even 2009. For many of us, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dunbar&rsquo;s number<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for phone calls is in the low single digits. Outside those few numbers, why answer an even remotely questionable number, ever?</p>
<p>If you squint right, robocalls appear they were  designed for the technological landscape of 1995, of <em>Friends</em> and cordless, landline phones. Robocalls,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->could<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have made sense in 1995. You get a call, it&rsquo;s Friday, there are no repeats of your favorite show on, you&rsquo;re a bit bored. Sure, maybe you&rsquo;ll pick up. Or in 1992, when receiving a phone call was not only a big, exciting deal!, but also a social imperative. You can&rsquo;t just let the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->answering machine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pick up? It could be&hellip;someone. Probably a human!</p>
<p>Sadly, the technological landscape I just described is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->exactly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folks who aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;technology natives&rdquo;. I suspect that&rsquo;s largely who Robocalls prey on: the bored and lonely, those who grew up before the pace of technological evolution surged and haven&rsquo;t developed a layered defense to those who would prey on them.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s nostalgia? It&rsquo;s the first Petty album I bought.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s humble? None of the songs are flashy, sitting right on the fence between songwriting and rock &lsquo;n roll.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the lyrics? I&rsquo;ve listened to this album <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a lot<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so I&rsquo;ve actually heard the lyrics and they&rsquo;re the right balance between clever and storytelling, for me.</p>

			 <p>Stephen Anderson on <a href="https://medium.com/@stephenanderson/the-future-of-design-computation-complexity-a434d2da3cd5">The Future of Design: Computation &amp; Complexity</a>. Like everything else, its going to get more weird. But, the large-scale outcome remains the same - design is deciding which elements are essential and which elements to remove:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real world isn’t so simple, and often has many competing goals and constraints. As a designer, what are you already doing, to help define the objectives and goals for a project? As critical as this is to teamwork, it’s the single, driving factor for machines. We can — and should — absolutely lean into defining these things. This has always been important, but will be vital as we hand over more decisions to Machine Learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definitely sounds like the future…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, what if I told you nothing could be designed that can’t be pitched, coded up, and released in an afternoon. Sound insane? I know of at least one company — the largest in their industry — that works this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…and we have to invent a future where we solve this future we created without thinking through the ramifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never before has technology allowed individuals to do more harm (or good) with such low effort.
— Christian Beck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>​Any practice where we can drive the iteration time to zero will end up requiring a new way of working where the computer generates a bunch of possible designs/systems/artifacts and a human applies education and intuition to determine which one to keep:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Play this out, and the role of human shifts from that of hands-on creator using software to render an idea to that of a conductor (or curator or cultivator?) working with software to explore possible options. In a sense, we develop a sort of symbiotic relationship with the machine; the machine generates possibilities that we then direct or tweak until arriving at an optimal solution. We see this playing out in nearly every industry, from manufacturing to the design of web sites to healthcare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>​A phase transition has already happened where the most successful systems occasionally touch the lives of city-sized populations. “Scale” means the most successful systems/platforms touch entire societies and a major fraction of the human population. I missed this forest amongst the trees of frameworks, languages, and databases. I suspect leaders like Zuckerberg and Dorsey missed it amongst the trees of growth and market acquisition.</p>
<p>Again, we have to invent a future where we fix the future we accidentally created:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is new in all this is visibility into the scale and scope of problems we now work on — we have to ask questions about impact and outcomes. Facebook and Twitter are platforms that have changed the world. The addictive properties of Pinterest and SnapChat are changing human behavior and social interactions. We can’t treat these things like simple web apps. They aren’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of inventing the future to fix the future is thinking more about feedback loops and how small changes in forces and incentives create outsized results:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the literature on formal systems thinking is dedicated to this topic of small changes. Reinforcing loops and balancing loops are the two foundational structures of systems thinking. The idea goes like this: Want to introduce a change? Don’t try to change the system (you can’t!). Instead, introduce a small change, or tweak an existing rule, then see what happens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More optimiscally, this last bit leads me to (continue to) think that the skills designers need aren’t so far off the skills developers need:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve identified about 11 ways of being that describe design. I won’t go into them all — there’s a post coming for that. But you’ve heard me mention some of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frame &amp; Reframe Problems</li>
<li>Work from Principles &amp; Values</li>
<li>Think in Systems and Contexts</li>
<li>Focus on Human Needs &amp; Motivations</li>
<li>See Possible Futures (where Others See Present Realities)</li>
<li>Thrive on Ambiguity</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

			 <p>I’m attempting to learn Rust. And really make it stick this time around. A lot of the “making it stick” part is making lists and having the discipline to stick with crossing items off them!</p>
<p>A smaller part is figuring out how I can notch very small victories no matter how much progress I make. This is crucial because I’ve got about a half an hour each morning to work on this!</p>
<p>My current favorite sort of small victory is to write up what I’ve learned if it doesn’t seem like I’m going to get far enough to commit new code behavior. This happens a fair bit when you’re working with a type checker after years of using a very implicit language.</p>
<p>So far I’ve written up what I’ve learned about the web frameworks <a href="https://github.com/therealadam/rust-web-bakeoff/blob/master/docs/actix.md">Nickel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/therealadam/rust-web-bakeoff/blob/master/docs/actix.md">Actix</a> so far.</p>
<p>The motivation for these little chunks of progress are the <a href="http://inessential.com/vespersyncdiary">learning journals Brent Simmons has published</a> over the years.</p>

			 <p>A stranger walks into an elevator. I say “how about this weather?!” They smirk, or let out a small laugh. It&rsquo;s easy to think, &ldquo;I am funny guy!&rdquo; But: that’s not a joke, it’s not funny. It’s just small talk and politeness in action. I am not, actually, the funny guy in this scenario.</p>
<p>When I was fourteen, I was really into standup comedy. I managed to find a club above a bowling alley that let me do a 2 minute set. The only constraint was that I couldn’t work blue. So I wrote two minutes of jokes, performed it a couple times, got a few laughs, and that was that. I figured out that I could get in front of people and tell some jokes, and I didn&rsquo;t need to rely on slapstick cursing to do it.</p>
<p>Also, I was fourteen and surrounded by teenagers. Teenagers make a lot of jokes at each other&rsquo;s expense, because they&rsquo;re cruel, don&rsquo;t know better, and aren&rsquo;t practiced humorists. I had experienced my share of being the subject of those jokes and decided I didn&rsquo;t want to be that kind of funny. Eventually, I came to the formulation that the best jokes aren&rsquo;t at someone else&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>As random things in one’s youth go, these two were pretty formative. I decided that if you can’t get a laugh without cursing or making a joke at someone’s expense by punching down, you weren’t actually funny.</p>
<p>Turns out these principles are pretty handy for the world we live in (and have always lived in, but some the future is not evenly distributed, etc.)</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AndyRichter/status/1079809155928449028">twitter.com/AndyRicht&hellip;</a></p>
<p>You can work blue, you can demean other people, you can say what&rsquo;s really on your mind, and you can punch down. You may get laughs, but they’re because people are sympathetic to your anger or cruelty. Or, maybe you’ve been bombing so long they’re just relieved you said something almost decent and the laugh to diffuse the situation. But, that’s not funny.</p>
<p>When a joke misses, when a standup flops, it doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ve become a humorless or prduce society. None of this means the end of humor or satire. It means we&rsquo;re going to separate the really excellent humorists from those who are merely humor-adjacent.</p>

			 <p>A couple things making me feel more productive lately:</p>
<p><strong>Jot down a theme for the day</strong>: at the beginning or end of the day, I make up some kind of near-platitude to help me focus and get stuff done. Recently: “Hack like a writer”, “Finish like a shipper”, “Focus on code”. They&rsquo;re a bit hustle-y, nearly cringe-y, and function only to get me back on track should I field a bunch of curveballs.</p>
<p><strong>“Sync&quot; written notes to a daily page</strong>: usually after lunch and before I wrap up work for the day, I transcribe any notes/sketches/todos/etc. I wrote down, on pen and paper, to a note (in <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a>). This seems to help me keep a clear head and not get overwhelmed on hectic days.</p>
<p>A couple things that feel right but haven&rsquo;t &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; as habits yet:</p>
<p><strong>Set out clothes for tomorrow before I go to bed</strong>: check the weather, set out what I&rsquo;ll wear tomorrow. I often forget, but when I don&rsquo;t I thank myself the next day.</p>
<p><strong>One big thing, a dozen or so little things</strong>: I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll go so far as eschewing a productivity/todo app, but using <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/one-thing/">One Thing</a> as a guideline when organizing my tasks often helps me reduce implausible lists to tractable plans.</p>

			 <p>Pitchfork: <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/talking-heads-remain-in-light/?mbid=social_twitter">Talking Head: <em>Remain in Light</em></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 1980, the conflict in music between what was thought and what was felt was in full cry. As disco continued to monopolize music you could dance to, rock reached a point of maximum theoretical sincerity. Pink Floyd’s The Wall, possibly the least ironic recording of all time, was the No. 1 album in America for 15 weeks. It was finally unseated by Bob Seger’s Against the Wind, which was knocked out of the top spot by Billy Joel’s Glass Houses. Ostensibly, these were works of deep sentiment. To a generation of punks, though, they were rock at its most bloodless and calculating.
&hellip;
The central insight of Talking Heads—what made them not just weird but exciting and relevant—was that their art-house affectation felt more sincere than a lot of American culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Completely unrelated but somewhat adjacent: the unseen magic trick Bruce Springsteen pulls off, for me, is to thread the needle between sincere storytelling, grandiose maximalism, and bar band raucousness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without Afrobeat, though, there is no Remain in Light. The central role of West-African polyrhythms in the album’s sound draws attention to a curious aspect of its longevity. Could a group of white musicians playing Afrobeat be taken sincerely in 2018? Virtually every genre of American music, including punk and especially rock, is taken from black forms. Afrobeat is not African-American, though; it’s straight-up African. The 21st-century sensibility finds something problematic in a band of white art-school types playing West African music. Earlier this year, the Beninese musician Angelique Kidjo released her own version of Remain in Light, which NPR described as “an authentic Afrobeat record” compared to the original. Given how closely Kidjo followed the Talking Heads’ arrangements, this description raises questions about what we mean when we say “authentic.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great review and a pretty good read.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I find this is one of the unexpected challenges of taking on engineering leadership responsibilities. First off, you have to do all the writing things right: use a clear and concise subject, say all the important things up front (probably in bullets!), and develop the important details in thoughtful prose. Even if you nail it there, some people just won&rsquo;t read, retain, and/or care about the information you have conveyed to them.</p>
<p>Hence: Always Be Repeating Yourself. Always.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prolific is better than perfect<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Jared Dees:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’m fond of restating this in terms of the quantity/quality trade-off. It’s easy for me to fall into the temptation of creating one essay/pull request/turn-of-phrase that exhibits all of the quality that should exemplify my work. But it’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->better<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for me to create a bunch of things that exhibit <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of that quality so I can better learn what is essential to the quality and what is illusory.</p>
<p>To borrow Dees’ model: if I write fifty-two blog posts in a year, several of them will be Not That Great. But after the first dozen or so, I’ll start to figure out what’s important in a story and what I thought was important but doesn’t really matter much. This is quantity <!-- raw HTML omitted -->creating<!-- raw HTML omitted --> quality; not a tradeoff!</p>
<p>The flip side is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chidi’s dilemma<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: spending your whole life trying to write every single thing about your area of expertise, with nuance, and producing something so impenetrable that not even a demigod can make sense of it.</p>
<p>In short: quantity doesn’t reduce quality. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quantity is the feedback loop that creates Quality<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>As a long time Rands fan, I highly recommend you partake of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rands Information Practices<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rands Slack Protocol<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Allow me to add some of my favorite tactics.</p>
<p>Get your browser tab situation under control; I get itchy when I have more than several tabs open! (But if you’re the sort who never has less than a few dozen tabs open, I still like you.) Move your most important and favorite blogs and websites into a feedreader. I like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Newsblur<!-- raw HTML omitted --> plus <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder macOS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder iOS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can even put Twitters and email subscriptions into Newsblur, which is some next level distraction management.</p>
<p>Learn the keyboard shortcuts. All of them. Dazzle people with your ability to dance across the keyboard and make computers do things. Bonus tip: picking up a mechanical keyboard will make you sound <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extra amazing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but slightly annoy the people who sit close to you.</p>
<p>Customize your system to remove distractions, allow you to focus, reduce drag, and move faster. If other people sit down at your computer and can’t operate it, that’s okay. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, don’t customize it too much. I want to get stuff done, not produce the ultimate hot rod computer for hot rodding computers.</p>
<p>Speaking of hot rodding, do not go too deep on productivity systems. I need a notebook-like app to think in and write stuff down. I need some kind of souped up todo list. Not much else. They are outboard brains, augmenting my ability to function as an adult and as someone thinking about and/or making things. Its tempting to read about everyone else’s Extremely Awesome Productivity Setup, but they’re doing different stuff and have different responsibilities; it’s entertainment, not education.</p>
<p>I cannot read the entire internet. Get really good at guessing whether something that comes across your desk is going to better your understanding of the world. Skip all the clickbait and tribal rage stuff. I look for stuff that provides insight into how we got here or what the future might look like.</p>
<p>That said, don’t accidentally filter your dear friends out in the process of managing the information onslaught. Put them in a special list or feed folder and look at it daily. Engage with them like its 2008 and the internet is still a promising thing that connects us to our friends.</p>
<p>Finally, I highly recommend you follow Rands’ best bit of advice, which is curiously tucked into the last footnote: replace screens by your bed (as many as possible, at least) with a book.</p>

			 <p>Over the years, I’ve heard a few times about something like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Decision Tables<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Hillel Wayne):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was usually some variation of teams using something like a truth table to define the logic of their application without using a mess of conditionals. It also turned out that there was a compiler optimization where these tables could be laid out such that figuring out which behavior was appropriate to all the inputs was faster than conditionals would have been.</p>
<p>Wayne doesn’t mention anything like this. But, there is mention of using decision tables with an RSpec macro to verify code behavior with less boilerplate assertion logic. So that’s neat!</p>
<p>If I had to sum up my style of coding, I’d say probably a third of it is about reducing the time I spend reading or writing conditional code. That’s where most of the bugs and frustration are. Pushing them down into the compiler, runtime, or database is a fun exercise too.</p>

			 <p>At some point in elementary or junior high school, we were taught all our essays should answer one of five questions: who, what, where, why, or how. These were, at the time, “the five W’s” of writing.</p>
<p>Why is my favorite because it provides context. Asking why usually gets me to the bottom of the situation. It often encapsulates the who/what/where/how/when. It’s the most open ended, which is probably the best part. Asking why almost always makes the next most important question obvious.</p>
<p>I still like the other ones too. When often yields interesting histories or chronologies. Who can lead to a nice bit of biographical or character background. How is great when I care most about progress over deep context. Where can give me a little bit of backstory about why a certain location or geography is important.</p>
<p>Asking why wraps up all of those. Why are shipping containers a standard size? Who decided it should be that way. How did that drastically change global shipping? When did this occur and what changes can we observe from it?</p>
<p>One word, one question. So much to learn!</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I was handed a fresh, nifty new laptop. This is, for me, mildly terrifying. Last time I did a clean operating system install was seven years ago. I&rsquo;ve carried an idiomatic mixtape of dotfiles, macOS preferences, files, and cruft with me on my personal laptop ever since.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to wrap my head around machine learning lately. Today I worked through the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TensorFlow.js tutorial on recognizing handwritten numbers with a neural network<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Herein, my notes and scribbles.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_4714&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;1537&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> TensorFlow: it&rsquo;s about turning linear algebra into models built of layers built of math[/caption]</p>
<p>My previous forays into machine learning left me a little frustrated: I could tell there was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->language,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pattern, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->notations<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to this, but I couldn&rsquo;t see them from the novelty of new-to-me words like sigmoids, convolution, and hidden layers. Turns out those are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->part<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the language.</p>
<p>But the really handy idioms are encoded in TensorFlow&rsquo;s high-level model-and-layer API. A model encapsulates a chunk of machine learning that can be trained to classify inputs (images, texts, etc.) based on a mess of training data (pre-classified stuff). Every model is built from a network of layers; layers use linear algebra to transform numbers into classifications.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve built a model, you feed it a bunch of training data so that it can learn the coefficients and other number-stuff that goes inside the math-y network. You also provide it with an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->optimizer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->loss<!-- raw HTML omitted --> function so that as the model is trained, it can know whether its getting better or worse at classifying data.</p>
<p>A really cool thing is you run this training process on your computer&rsquo;s GPU. GPUs, like machine learning models, are big networks of fast math-y stuff. Beautiful symmetry! On the other hand, you usually can&rsquo;t fit your training data set into GPU memory, so you end up batching your test data and submitting it to the GPU in loops.</p>
<p>Once all this runs, you&rsquo;ve got a trained model that can take image inputs (in this case, hand-written digits) and classify them to decimal numbers (0-9). Magic!</p>

<p>I now suspect that given the first two developers, its possible to make noticeably more Quality by putting little bits of thoughtfulness throughout the code. Unless the person moving fast and loose is actively undermining the quality of the system, they will notice the Quality practices or idioms and adopt them. Code review is the first line of defense to pump the brakes and inform someone moving a little too fast/loose that there’s a Quality way to do what they’re after without slowing down too much.</p>

			 <p>Over the past few weekends, I’ve been reading on two topics which are way out of my technical confidence. I’ve spent the majority of my software development career building web applications and neither of these are very coincident with web apps right now:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With blockchain stuff, there are very interesting fundamentals underlying a sprawling system of hype and information asymmetry. Every time I go in, it’s “shields up!”, time to defend myself from people trading reputation for short-term speculation or actively spreading inaccurate information. In other words, here comes the snake oil salesmen!</p>
<p>That said, there are cool ideas in there. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Solidity<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a language built into <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ethereum<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for writing programs that run alongside the blockchain. You wouldn’t want to build a normal application this way, but if you want some degree of confidence in a system, like voting or accounting, a system inside Ethereum and Solidity might make sense. Even more strange, to a web developer, you have to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pay<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the compute time that program requires in Ethereum itself. Strange and intriguing!</p>
<p>By comparison, machine learning is equally hyped but has little speculation. They both involve about the same level of mathematical and computational complexity. Which is probably how I’ve managed to avoid both so far: I’m far better at social reasoning, which is a big deal in web applications, than I am at math. But I’m trying to change that!</p>
<p>I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->deeplearning.js<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it seems like a nice gateway into the domain of building neural networks for machine learning, computer vision, etc. And it utilizes your GPUs, if present, which is pretty neat because GPUs are strange little computers we seem to have increasingly more of as the days go on.</p>
<p>No idea where this line of thinking is going. All I know is it&rsquo;s more fun than reading about yet another client or server side framework. ;)</p>

<p>I talked myself into and out of porting this website to Jekyll three times over the past week. Hence, the writing dropped off, which is silly because I just blogged about not tinkering with blog tools in the last month. WordPress.com doesn’t quite do the things I want it to and its syntax highlighting is keeping the dream of the nineties alive. I’m writing these short form bits in lieu of a sidebar thing for now. No idea how I’ll make do with the code highlighting.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was lucky enough to attend Strange Loop this year. I described the conference to friends as a gathering of minds interested in programming esoterica. The talks I attended were appropriately varied: from very academic slides to illustrated hero’s journeys, from using decomposed mushrooms to create materials to programming GPUs, from JavaScript to Ruby. Gotcha, that last one was not particularly varied.</p>
<p>In short, most of the language-centric conferences I’ve been to in the past were about “hey look at what I did with this library or weird corner of the language”, though the most recent Ruby/Rails conference are more varied than this. By comparison, Strange Loop was more about “I did this thing that I’m excited about and its a little brainy but not intimidating and also I’m really excited about it.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I started the weekend off checking out the Elm community. I already think pretty highly of the language. I would certainly use it for a green-field project.</p>
<p>Size, excitement, and employment-wise, Elm is about where Ruby was when I joined the community in 2005. Lots of excited folks, a smattering of employed folks, and a good technical/social setup for growth.</p>
<p>A nice thing about the community is that there is no “other” that Elm is set against. Elm code often needs to interface with JavaScript to get at functionality like location or databases, so they don’t turn their nose up at it. It’s a symbiotic relationship. Further, most Elm developers are probably coming from JavaScript, so its a pretty friendly relationship. This is nice shift from the tribalism of yore.</p>
<p>It’s also exciting that Elm is already more diverse than Ruby was at the same point in its growth/inflection curve. Fewer dudes, more beginners, and none of the “pure Ruby” sort of condescension towards Rails and web development.</p>
<p>Favorite talks:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The majority of the talks referenced Elm creator Evan Czaplicki’s approach to designing APIs. He is humble enough that I don’t think this will backlash like it did with DHH’s opinions did with Rails.</p>
<p>By far the biggest corporate footprint in the community and talks was NoRedInk. Nearly half of the talks were by someone at the company.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Types for Ruby<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: it seems like they’ve implemented a full-blown type <!-- raw HTML omitted -->system<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for Ruby. It’s got all the gizmos and gadgets you might expect: unions, generics, gradual typing. It applies all its checks at runtime though, and they didn’t say if it does exhaustive checking, so I’m not sure how handy it would be in the way that e.g. Elm or Flow are. On my list of things to check out later.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Level up your concurrency skills with Rust<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Learning Rust’s concepts for memory and concurrency safety, i.e. resources, ownerships, and lifetimes, can help you program in any language. Putting concurrency into a system is refactoring for out-of-orderness and most likely a retrofit of the underlying structure. Rust models memory like a resource, ala file handles or network sockets are modeled by the operating system. Rust resource borrowing in summary: if you can read it, no one else can write it; if you can write it, no one else can read or write it; borrows are checked at compile time so there is no runtime overhead/cost.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->GPGPU programming with Metal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Your processor core has a medium sized arithmetic logic unit and a giant control unit (plus as much memory/cache as they can spare). A GPU is thousands of arithmetic logic units. Besides drawing amazing pictures, you can use all those arithmetic logic units to train/implement a neural network, do machine vision or image processing, run machine learning algorithms, and any kind of linear algebra or vector calculus. Work is sent to the GPU by loading data/state into buffers, converting math instructions to GPU code and load that into GPU buffers, and then let the GPU go wild executing it.</p>
<p>Seeking a better culture and organization of open source maintainership (no talk video). Projects are getting smaller, more fragmented, and attracting no community (ed. the unintended consequence of extreme modularity?) Bitcoin and Ethereum have very little backing despite the astronomical amounts of money in the ecosystem. We need a new perspective on funding open source work. Consumption of open source has won, but production of open source is still in a pretty bad place.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How to be a compiler<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Knitting is programming; you can even compile between knitting description pseudo-languages. Implemented Design by Numbers, a Processing predecessor, as transpiler to SVG.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Measuring and optimizing tail latency<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Activating instrumentation and “slow-path” techniques on live web requests that run so long they will fall into the 99th percentile. Switch processor voltage to “power up” a processor that’s running a slow request so it will finish faster, e.g. switch a core from low power/500MHz mode to high power/2GHz mode.</p>
<p>Really using functional ideas of composition and state in production, consumer-facing applications (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->e.g. the NY Times<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->using ML-style type checkers with JavaScript<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (e.g. Flow and Elm).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My two favorite talks by far:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Making digital art with JavaScript, WebGL, vdom and immutability<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scraping/querying/aggregating image data from various space missions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (e.g. Jupiter and Pluto flybys).</p>
<p>Facebook stopped using datacenter routers and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->started building their own servers that program the networking chips a router would use from CentOS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, basically giving them programmable routers that deploy like you would update infrastructure like Nginx or memcached. I wonder when/if treating network devices as software will scale down to your typical large company?</p>

			 <p>I’m intrigued by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->folks having luck building virtualized development environments for localhost setups<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It sounds like fun to work in this kind of workflow. I never want to do the legwork to make this work, though.</p>
<p>I did the preliminaries for this last year and ended up turning back from it. I understand Docker and virtualization superficially at best. I don’t want to impose it on teammates. It’s still too hard to search for Unix-y error messages and fix your development environment. Trying to figure out if your host Unix, Docker, or a virtualized Unix are the problem is not something I wanted to do to someone else.</p>
<p>Is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazon Lightsail<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a move by AWS into the space occupied by Linode, Digital Ocean, etc.? Related to virtualized localhost setups: someone write me a thing to drop my dotfiles from macOS onto a Digital Ocean, AWS, etc. instance and do development from an iPad, keyboard, and SSH client.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hammerspoon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a really cool to do all-the-things with your keyboard and some Lua. I use it to launch/switch to my most frequent dozen apps and some light Markdown helpers. But, something about it is correspondingly creepy. It can, theoretically, scoop up every keystroke. (Which probably every bit of open source I install via Homebrew could, to be honest) But maybe I could replace it with a clever bit of Alfred workflow and scripting. Catch a triggering keystroke and then give me a constrained list of apps to switch to. Yes, this is a very strange way to hit <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Command-Tab<!-- raw HTML omitted -->! I wonder how well a few custom Alfred workflows fit into a dotfiles repo.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes, programmers like to disparage “magical code”. They say magical code is causing their bugs, magical code is offensive to use, magical code is harder to understand, we should try to write “less magical” code.</p>
<p>“Wait, what’s magic?”, I hear you say. That’s what I’m here to talk about! (Warning: this post contains an above-average density of “air quotes”, ask your doctor if your heart is strong enough for “humorous quoting”.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It’s not inscrutable code. It’s not bad code. It doesn’t intentionally defy understanding, like an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->obfuscated code contest<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->code golfing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I can start to understand why a big of code is frustratingly magical to me by categorizing it. (Hi, I’m Adam, I love categorizing things, it’s awful.)</p>
<p>“Mathemagical” code escapes my understanding due to its foundation in math and my lack of understanding therein. I recently read <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Purely Functional Data Structures<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is a great book, but the parts on proving e.g. worst-case cost for amortized operations on data structures are completely beyond my patience or confidence in math. Once Greek symbols enter the text, my brain kinda “nope!”s out.</p>
<p>“Metamagic” is hard to understand due to use of metaprogramming. Code that generates code inside code is a) really cool and b) a bit of a mind exploder at first. When it works, its glorious and not “magical”. When it falls short, it’s a mess of violated expectations and complaints about magic. PSA: don’t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->metaprogram when you can program<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>“Sleight of hand” makes it harder for me to understand code because I don’t know where the control flow or logic goes. Combining inheritance and mixins when using Ruby is a good example of control flow sleight-of-hand. If a class extends <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Foo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, includes <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and all three define a method <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do_the_thing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which one gets called (trick question: all of them, trick follow-up question: in what order!)? The Rails router is a good example of logical sleight-of-hand. If I’m wondering how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->root to: &ldquo;some_controller/index&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> works and I have only the Rails sources on me, where would I start looking to find that logic? For the first few years of Rails, I’d dig around in various files before I found the trail to that answer.</p>
<p>“Multi-level magic schemes” is my new tongue-in-cheek way to explain a tool like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tmux<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It’s a wonderful tool for those of us who prefer to work in (several) shells all day. I’m terrified of when things go wrong with it, though. To multiplex several shells into one process while persisting that state across user sessions requires <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tmux<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to operate at the intersection of Unix shells, process trees, and redrawing interfaces to a terminal emulator. I understand the first two in isolation, but when you put it all together, my brain again “nope!”s out of trying to solve any problems that arise. Other multi-level magic schemes include object-relational mappers, game engines, operating system containers, and datacenter networking.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’m writing this because I often see ineffective reactions to “magical” code. Namely, 1) identify code that is frustrating, 2) complain on Twitter or Slack, 3) there is no step 3. Getting frustrated is okay and normal! Contributing only negative energy to the situation is not.</p>
<p>Instead, once I find a thing frustrating, I try to step back and figure out what’s going on. How does this bit of code or tool work? Am I doing something that it recommends against or doesn’t expect? Can I get back on the “golden path” the code is built for? Can I find the code and understand what’s going on by reading it? Often some combination of these side quests puts me back on my way an out of frustration’s way.</p>
<p>Other times, I don’t have time for a side quest of understanding. If that’s the case, I make a mental note that “here be dragons” and try to work around it until I’m done with my main quest. Next time I come across that mental map and remember “oh, there were dragons here!”, I try to understand the situation a little better.</p>
<p>For example, I have a “barely tolerating” relationship with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->webpack<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I’m glad it exists, it mostly works well, but I feel its human factors leave a lot to be desired. It took a few dives into how it works and how to configure it before I started to develop a mental model for what’s going on such that I didn’t feel like it was constantly burning me. I probably even complained about this in the confidence of friends, but for my own personal assurances, attached the caveat of “this is magical because it’s unfamiliar to me.”</p>
<p>Which brings me to my last caveat: all this advice works for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me<!-- raw HTML omitted --> because I’ve been programming for quite a while. I have tons of knowledge, the kind anyone can read and the kind you have to win by experience, to draw upon. If you’re still in your first decade of programming, nearly everything will seem like magic. Worse, it’s hard to tell what’s useful magic, what’s virtuous magic, and what’s plain-old mediocre code. In that case: when you’re confronted with magic, consult me or your nearest Adam-like collaborator.</p>

<p>Consider: incremental approaches consist of taking a large scope and finding smaller, still-valuable scopes inside of it. Risk is 100% proportional to scope. Time-to-deliver grows as scope grows. Cancellation and deployment risk grow as time-to-deliver grows. It&rsquo;s not quite math, but it is easy to demonstrate on a whiteboard. In case you happen to need to work with someone who wants large scope <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> low risk <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> low time-to-delivery.</p>

			 <p>Running an application across two physical databases is not a straightforward thing. One of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->relatively<!-- raw HTML omitted --> easier ways to do it involves assigning each database instance a shard number and then arranging for all your primary key IDs to end with that number. For example, shard 0 generates IDs like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1230, 40, 482340<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, shard 1 generates IDs like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1231, 41, 482341<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and shard 2 generates IDs like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1232, 42, 482342<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, etc. all the way up to 9. If you want more than 10 database shards, it gets more involved.</p>
<p>My brain is wired oddly, so I came to wonder how you would quickly get the shard ID for an ID (e.g. shard 1 for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1231<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). This is really easy with decimal math; you just divide by 10. However, we run our databases on computers that can only do binary math, so its not actually simple.</p>
<p>But it turns out you can do it quite fast! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There&rsquo;s one weird number<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, expressed as <code>&lt;code&gt;0x1999999A</code><!-- raw HTML omitted --> hexadecimal, that is very close to multiplying by the fraction <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1/10<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (plus further binary math and register trickery). Thus you can do this in only a few instructions on Intel processors released in the past twenty years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really glad someone else figured this out.</p>

<p>In short, JavaScript increases the chances someone will level up their career. Maybe they&rsquo;ll continue in sales or marketing but use JS as a secret weapon to get more done or avoid tedium.

<p>Bottom line: JavaScript, like Ruby and PHP before it, is the next thing that&rsquo;s improving the chances non-programmers become programmers and reach the life-improving salary and career trajectories software developers have enjoyed for the past decade or two.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a moment of despair when extracting functionality from a larger library, framework, or program. The idea grows, a seed at first and then a full-blown tree, that the coupling in this functionality isn&rsquo;t all bad. A lot of people talk only about coupling and leave out cohesion. They aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive! When the two are balanced, it&rsquo;s hard to come up with a reason to start extracting.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sometimes that moment of despair strikes when you start really digging into the domain and realize this chunk of functionality isn&rsquo;t what you thought it was. Maybe it&rsquo;s not coherent (see above!) or perhaps the model of the domain isn&rsquo;t deep enough. This is a pretty good signal to hit the brakes on the refactoring, figure the domain out, and reconsider the course of action.</p>
<p>Feature envy rears its head in extractions too. Patterns of crosstalk between the existing thing and the new thing are a sure sign of feature envy. It&rsquo;s tempting to say, hey maybe you really need a third thing in the middle. That&rsquo;s probably making matters worse though.</p>
<p>That said, changing bidirectional communication to unidirectional is usually a positive thing. Same for replacing any kind of asynchronous communication with synchronous. Or replacing lockstep coordination with asynchronous messaging. Envy is tricky!</p>
<p>(I) often encourage starting a new service or application within your existing &ldquo;mothership&rdquo;. The trendy way to say this right now is &ldquo;monorepo all the things&rdquo; or build a &ldquo;modular monolith&rdquo;. I find this compelling because you can leverage a lot of existing effort into operationalizing, tooling, and infrastructure. Once you know the domain and technical concerns specific to the new thing, you can easily extract into its own thing if you need to. The other edge of a monorepolith is that path dependence is a hell of a thing. Today is almost certainly an easier day to split stuff out than tomorrow.</p>
<p>A thing to consider pursuing is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backend-for-frontend<!-- raw HTML omitted --> service in pursuit of a specific frontend. It doesn&rsquo;t even have to serve an application. You may have services that are specific to mobile, desktop, apps, APIs, integrations, etc. Each of these may need drastically different rates of change, technical features, and team sets.</p>
<p>Probably don&rsquo;t split out a service so that a bunch of specialized people can build a &ldquo;center of excellence&rdquo; for the rest of the organization to rely upon. This is a very fancy way to say &ldquo;we are too cool for everyone else and we just can&rsquo;t stand the work everyone else is doing&rdquo;. On their best day, the Excellence team will be overwhelmed by the volume of work they have put in front of themselves to make Everything Good. On their worst day, they will straight give up.</p>
<p>If you split something out, realize you&rsquo;re going to have to maintain it until you replace it. And you&rsquo;re going to rebuild the airplane while it&rsquo;s flying. If you&rsquo;re not really into that, stop now. Just because you can&rsquo;t stand Rails, relational databases, or whatever doesn&rsquo;t mean you should jump into an extraction.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>With feedback, like jokes, timing is everything. Good feedback at a bad time won&rsquo;t do the trick.</p>
<p>I’ve mostly experienced programming feedback through pull requests. This is way better than no feedback. However, since most pull requests occur at the end of work, and not somewhere in the middle, some kinds of feedback are not conducive to pull requests.</p>
<p>Suppose all feedback falls somewhere on two axes: “timeliness” and “depth”. The narrow sweet spot of code review is apparent:</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_4302&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;861&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Pairing and code review are not so similar[/caption]</p>
<p>The sweet spot in the top-right corner is when code review works best: unhurried and in-depth feedback. I’d hesitate to call the lower-right corner of hurried, minimal feedback a code review at all; it’s more like rubber stamping.</p>
<p>I’ve often referred to code review, flippantly, as the worst form of pairing yet invented. I’ve given a lot of code review feedback in the past that was better suited to the synchronous nature of pairing than the very asynchronous nature of code reviews. That said, I feel like pairing is an excellent way to give all manners of feedback in the moment the code is being conceived or written. You can immediately point out possible incorrectness or better designs and talk it out, with the code at hand, with your collaborator.</p>
<p>However, we can’t all pair all the time. Let me show you how I’m trying to better time my feedback when I can’t share it immediately.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Consider four PR subject lines. Which ones are appropriate for architectural ideas? What about optimization ideas? When is deep refactoring feedback appropriate? Can I look at one of these in an hour when I’m done with my current task?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Lately, when I do pull request reviews, I use these guidelines:</p>

<p>Use different tactics when sharing feedback for code review; it’s not pairing. Identify patches, reviews, and full feedback pull requests. Sanity check patches, look for correctness in review, look for design in review. Use GitHub’s review process to indicate your feedback is “FYI” vs. “fix this before merging”. Time-to-response is most important for patches and fixes.</p>
<p>Above all: giving feedback is a skill you acquire with practice, empathy, and maintaining a constructive attitude.</p>

			 <p>I learned a lot of things from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Complexity and Strategy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Terry Crowley:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In other words, the ability to change a product is directly proportional to the size of N (features, requirements, spec points, etc.) for the system that express that product. You may find practices that multiply N by 0.9 so you go a little faster. You may back yourself into a corner that multiply N by 1.1 so you go a little slower. But, to borrow again from Fred Brooks, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->there is no silver bullet<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Essential domain complexity is immutable unless you reduce the size of the domain, i.e. cut existing features.</p>
<p>Not even fancy new technologies are correlated with reducing your multiplier, in the long run:</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m playing with typeful language stuff. Having only done a pinch of Haskell, Scala, and Go tinkering amidst Ruby work over the past ten years, it&rsquo;s jarring. But, things are much better than they were before I started with Ruby.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Elm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in particular is like working with a teammate who is helpful but far more detail oriented than myself. It lets me know when I missed something. It points out cases I overlooked. It&rsquo;s good software.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done less with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I like the idea of incrementally adding types to JavaScript. The type system is pragmatic and makes it easy to introduce types to a program as time and gumption permit. Having <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a repository of type definitions for popular libraries<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a great boon too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also tinkering with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Elixir<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is not really a typed thing.

<p>I&rsquo;m more interested in types stuff for frontends than backends. I want some assurance, in the wild world of browsers and devices, that my systems are soundly structured. Types buy me that. Backends, I feel, benefit from a little more leeway, and are often faster to deploy quick fixes to, such that I can get away without the full rigor of types.</p>

			 <p>Hello, America. We have to talk. You are built on top of a mountain of federal (a trillion or so dollars) debt. That debt covers some things we need (roads, health care, social safety nets, education, scientific research) and subsidizes distasteful things (energy companies, military contractors, banks, real estate). You could consider that debt the tip of the iceberg. We can see how it contributes to the annual federal budget in dollars and by percentages. It’s a measurable, knowable thing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s also a ton of unmeasured debt we are accruing. We have to pay the price for it through social norms and charity. Here’s a hackish list:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But I digress and rant. And rant. Economists call these <!-- raw HTML omitted -->externalities<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s when you have some accidental cost or benefit that is paid for by a third party, e.g. Walmart paying less than a living wage because the government will pick up the tab through welfare.</p>
<p>Point is, we’re underpaying for a lot of stuff. And that’s fun for some of us. We eat avocado toast, take exciting trips around the world, maybe drive race cars. We sort ourselves out so we don’t see the literally millions of people suffering because we’re not paying what it takes to give everyone a chance at doing better off than their parents or picking themselves up when life knocks them down. And then when some transparently awful populist blowhard runs for president, we’re shocked, just shocked, that he ends up winning.</p>
<p>Bring the higher taxes. Make me pay more to eat out. Charge me more for gas. I don’t mind thinking twice about whether I should subscribe to HBO <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Showtime <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Netflix. If I can’t go to Disney World as often, so be it.</p>
<p>It’s a small price to pay to have avoided what’s coming over the next four years: an increasingly unequal, unfair world for those of us who aren’t already doing great and white and male. Let me pay more for a greater country where everyone, not just the affluent, seek what it is that makes them happy in life without the fear of illness, bad circumstance, political or racial backlash. Let&rsquo;s not lord that greater country over people to &ldquo;motivate them to work harder and escape their current lot in life&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s price the externalities that separate the concerns of the rich from the stresses of the poor and let&rsquo;s all pay our share.</p>

			 <p>I try <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hard to avoid interrupting people. Golden rule: if I don’t want interruptions I shouldn’t impose them on other, right? Not entirely so.</p>
<p>Having teammates around, and interrupting them, has saved my butt. I’ve avoided tons of unnecessary work and solving the wrong problems, and that’s just the last week!</p>
<p>Communicating with others is a messy, lossy affair. We send messages, emails, bug reports with tons of partial context and implicit assumption. Not (always) because we lack empathy or want to bury ideas in unstated assumptions, but because we’re in a hurry, multitasking, or stressed out.</p>
<p>When you interrupt a co-worker you can turn five minutes of messages back and forth to thirty seconds of “Did you mean this?” “Yeah I meant that!” “Cool.”</p>
<p>When you interrupt a co-worker you can ask “this made sense but you also mentioned this which didn’t entirely make sense” and they can say “oh yes because here’s the needle in the haystack” and now you can skip straight to working with the needle instead of sifting through the haystack that was your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->own<!-- raw HTML omitted --> assumptions wrongly contextualized.</p>
<p>If your coworker is smart, they are keeping track of why people interrupt them. Later they’ll try to make it easier for you to not interrupt them, e.g. write documentation or automate a task. Maybe they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->want<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you to interrupt them so that whenever someone wonders “why haven’t we automated this?” they can talk to you about how it’s important to have a human hand on it rather than let failed automation go unnoticed.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to interrupt someone. I know the struggle. I do my best to respect when people put their head down to concentrate and get stuff done. I always spend a few minutes rereading communications or spelunking the code, logs, or whatever context I have before interrupting someone. It’d be rude to interrupt before I even started trying. But, there’s a moment when the cost and benefit of interrupting someone so I can get something done faster swings towards mutual benefit. That’s when I interrupt them.</p>

			 <p>I am basically OK with the tradeoffs involved in using autoloading in Rails. I do, however, rankle a little bit at this bit of advice in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rails guide to developing engines<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_4216&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;661&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Screencapture from Rails Guide to Engines[/caption]</p>
<p>In short, when configuring an engine from an initializer, you’re supposed to protect references to autoloaded application classes (e.g. models) by encoding them as strings. Your engine later <!-- raw HTML omitted -->constantize<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s the string to a class and everything is back to normal.</p>
<p>A thing I am not OK with is “programming with strings”. As an ideal, strings are inputs from other machines or humans and internal references to code are something else. In Ruby, symbols fill in nicely for the latter. Could I refer to classes as Symbols instead of Strings and live with the tradeoffs?</p>
<p>Well it turns out, oddly enough, that Rails is pretty sparing with Symbol extensions. It has only 120 methods after Rails loads, compared to 257 for String. There are no specific extensions to symbol, particularly for class-ifying them. Even worse (for my purposes), there isn’t a particularly great way to use symbols to refer to namespaced classes (e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Foo::Bar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>But, the Rails router has a shorthand for referring to namespaced classes and methods, e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->foo/bar#baz<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It doesn’t bother me at all.</p>
<p>In code I have to work with, if at all possible, I’d rather refer to classes like so:</p>

			 <p>The downside to the Republicans proposing a healthcare bill is that it&rsquo;s a major legislative disappointment, given they&rsquo;ve spent seven years symbolically opposing healthcare. The upside is that, at least, we have something substantive to discuss about healthcare. The silver lining is possibly voters will come to see the Republican party for its cynicism.</p>
<p>What is there to talk about? We could start with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Brooks on how we got to the point<!-- raw HTML omitted --> wherein the GOP has received their moment in the sun. He argues that neglecting three ideas led us to the propaganda of the Trump era:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Brooks argued Obama should have addressed these crises, which the ACA arguably did for the second. IMO, Republicans stoked all three of these fires while pointing their fingers elsewhere. Supply side economics built the first crisis, privatization the second, and propaganda media the third.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Congress, Paul Ryan is rolling up his sleeves and saying taking healthcare away from Americans is about giving them freedom. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paul Ryan&rsquo;s Misguided Sense of Freedom<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>He went on to argue that Obamacare abridges this freedom by telling you what to buy. But his first thought offers a meaningful and powerful definition of freedom. Conservatives are typically proponents of negative liberty: the freedom from constraints and impediments. Mr. Ryan formulated a positive liberty: freedom derived from having what it takes to fulfill one’s needs and therefore to direct one’s own life.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(Positive and negative freedom, as terminology, always confuse me; this bit is well written!) This op-ed makes a nice point: healthcare as envisioned by Obamacare, and other more progressive schemes, imagine an America where we are free from worrying about health care. Preventative care happens because we needn&rsquo;t worry whether we should spend the money elsewhere or take the day off. Major health care events like pregancy or major illness are only intimidating because they are life events, not life-changing unfunded expenditures.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why, outside of deep cynicism of the American dream, Republicans in Congress would not want this kind of free world.</p>

<p>Sunk.</p>
<p>Luckily, only an hour in, I rolled over to the product manager and asked if it was okay if we were a little clever about the feature. We couldn&rsquo;t request All The Things, but we could request Each of The Things that we knew about. It wasn&rsquo;t great, but it was better than sunk.</p>
<p>The product manager proceeded to tell me that was okay and in fact that&rsquo;s kind of how the feature works for other APIs too.

<p>I wrote basically no code that day. Someone who &ldquo;crushes code&rdquo; or &ldquo;moves fast and breaks things&rdquo; would say I didn&rsquo;t pull my weight. Screw &lsquo;em.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of my friends<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been working on a sort of community software for several years now. Uniquely, this software, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uncommon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is designed to avoid invading and obstructing your life. From speaking with my Brian, it sounds like people often mistake this community for a forum or a social media group. That’s natural; we often understand new things by comparing or reducing them to old things we already understand.</p>
<p>The real Quality Uncommon is trying to embody is that of a small dinner party. How do people interact in these small social settings? How can software provide constructive social norms like you’d naturally observe in that setting?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’m currently reading <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How Buildings Learn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->(also a video series)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It’s about architecture, building design, fancy buildings, un-fancy buildings, pretty buildings, ugly buildings, etc. Mostly it’s about how buildings are suited for their occupants or not and whether those buildings can change over time to accommodate the current or future occupants. The main through-lines of the book are 1) function dictates form and 2) function is learned over time, not specified.</p>
<p>A building that embodies the Quality described by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How Buildings Learn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> uses learning and change over time to become better. A building with the Quality answers 1) How does one design a building such that it can allow change over time while meeting the needs and wants of the customer paying for its current construction? and 2) How can the building learn about the functions its occupants need over time so that it changes at a lower cost than tearing it down and starting a new building?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bret Victor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has bigger ideas for computing. He seeks to design systems that help us explore and reason on big problems. Rather than using computers as blunt tools for doing the busy work of our day-to-day jobs as we currently do, we should build systems that help all of us think creatively at a higher level than we currently do.</p>
<p>Software that embodies that Quality is less like a screen and input device and more like a working library. Information you need, in the form of books and videos, line the walls. Where there are no books, there are whiteboards for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping track of things. In the center of the room are wide, spacious desks; you can sit down to focus on working something through or stand and shuffle papers around to try and organize a problem such that an insight reveals itself. You don’t work <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the computer, you work <!-- raw HTML omitted -->amongst<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the information.</p>

			 <p>Over the years, many hours in front of a computer have afforded me the gift of keyboarding skills. I&rsquo;ve put in the Gladwellian ten thousand hours of work and it&rsquo;s really paid off. I type fairly quickly, somewhat precisely, and often loudly.</p>
<p>Pursuant to this great talent, I&rsquo;ve optimized my computer to have everything at-hand when I&rsquo;m typing. I don&rsquo;t religiously avoid the mouse. I do seek more ways to use the keyboard to get stuff done quickly and with ease. Thanks to tools like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alfred<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hammerspoon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I&rsquo;ve acheived that.</p>
<p>With the greatest apologies to Bruce Springsteen:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Like every good documentary on accomplished performers, there&rsquo;s a dark side to this keyboard computering talent I posess. There are downsides to my keyboard-centric lifestyle:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All that said, when I am in the zone, my fingers dance over this keyboard, I think with my fingers, and it&rsquo;s great.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve noticed lots of Rails apps end up with database-backed lookup tables. Particularly in systems with some kind of customer or subscription management, it’s almost guaranteed that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->User<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Customer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> models <!-- raw HTML omitted -->belong_to<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SubscriptionLevel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> models. Thus, you frequently need to query <!-- raw HTML omitted -->both<!-- raw HTML omitted --> models.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for avoidable database work, as I sometimes have, this seems like low-hanging fruit. Plan level models very rarely change. You could replace those <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SubscriptionLevel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> models with a hardcoded data object and move on.</p>
<p>In my experience, you now have a white whale on your hands. This low-hanging fruit may haunt you for a while. It could cause you to invent increasingly implausible mechanisms for ridding yourself of this “technical debt” (scare quotes, it’s a trade-off and not actual technical debt). Teammates will appear drowsy when you mention this problem and its technical details, then back away slowly.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Why is it so tricky to convert AR database lookups to non-AR in-memory lookups?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve attempted this twice. Both times, I tried to grab as little surface area as possible and ended up with nearly all of the models. A current teammate is trying now and suffering a somewhat similar fate. They’re more detail-oriented and motivated than I am, so I hope they’ll succeed. (Ed. they succeeded!)</p>
<p>Is this phenomenon something we can easily write off to coupling or is it something else? My pessimistic, gossip-y sense leads me to think people who have become ORM Skeptic went down this path thinking it&rsquo;s inevitable if you accept an ORM into your life. They came away a dark shade of who they were with the conclusion that ORMs ruin everything. However, the phases of coping that involve a three thousand word essay and then writing a new database layer thing don’t actually solve this problem.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the ActiveRecord flavor of ORMs, it is easy to describe model graphs and interactions amongst those graphs. Once you’ve got the whole model graph, its often difficult to isolate a subsection of it. AR, in particular, can make it easy to violate Demeter and reach through that graph in hard-to-refactor ways.</p>
<p>Our lack of great and general tools for working with Ruby code that uses these graphs and rewriting said code is another big challenge. Solving these problems requires visualizing the direct and transitive connections between models. Then you need some kind of refactoring tool to rewrite code to use an indirection object instead of directly coupling. We lack both of those in the Ruby world.</p>
<p>Optimistically, I’d think this is a case of refactoring smarter. Given a solid test suite you could:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The thing you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wouldn&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> want to do, and where I faltered at least once, was to let it become a long-running task. When you&rsquo;re making changes all over the code base, any amount of churn behind your back is potentially crippling. If you can freeze the code base, I highly recommend it. (Coincidentally, this is exactly what my smarter-than-me teammate did!)</p>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that, inevitably, you will come across weird uses of ActiveRecord and Rails that you didn&rsquo;t know about, are pretty sure you don&rsquo;t like, and have to work with anyway. Set aside time for these known unknowns.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When dealing with potentially large, radical changes to your application code, how radical are you willing to go to make many smaller changes than one big one? There&rsquo;s no crisp answer here. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All code grows awkward in different ways<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As always: divide, conquer, and celebrate your victories!</p>

			 <p>Since I started writing web applications in around 1999, there’s been an ever-present boundary around what you can do in a browser. As browsers have improved, we have a new line in the sand. They&rsquo;re more enabling now, but equally annoying.</p>
<p>Applications running on servers in a datacenter (Ruby, Python, PHP) can’t:</p>

<p>It may seem like native applications are the way to go. They can do all the things browsers cannot. But!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In practice, this means there’s a step before building an application where I figure out where some functionality lives. “This needs to think real hard, it goes on a very specific kind of server. This needs to store some data so it has to go on that other server. That needs to present the data to the user, so I have to bridge the server and browser. But we’d really like to put this in app stores soooo, how are we going to get something resembling a native app without putting a lot of extra effort into it?”</p>
<p>There’s entirely good reasons that this dichotomy has emerged, but it’s kinda dumb too. In other words, paraphrasing Churchill:</p>

<p>I can’t handle adult responsibilities. Any external demands on my time are met with impatience. My thoughts drift to the problem when I’m not otherwise occupied.

			 <p>To me, a great car is equal part shape, technology, sound, and history. It seems like the future of cars is all technology at the expertise of all other factors. What will it mean to love cars over the next ten years?</p>
<p>A well shaped car is defined by function. A long hood accommodates an engine running the length of the car and not between the wheels. Aerodynamic surfaces, not too many please, keep the car pressed to the road. The shape of the car is further of a function of air inlets to cool all the moving parts. Once all that is done, you can think of the form, getting just the right balance of smooth curves and straight lines.</p>
<p>Future cars are likely to move toward aerolumps. Drag is always the enemy of cars, doubly so for anything seeking efficiency. But the form needed to accommodate moving parts (read: combutions engines and their support infrastructure) will go away. You&rsquo;re left with just a bubble holding the passengers. Not inspiring.</p>
<p>The sound of future cars is the sound of air running over the car and tires meeting the road. You may hear the occassional whine of an electric motor, perhaps an artifical soundtrack inspired by old combustion engines. No more growls, burps, and high-rev screams.</p>
<p>When all this sorts out, some companies will have a more interesting product due to their use of technology. A lot of companies will have a more boring but practical product. We will surely say, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t make them like they used to&rdquo; because literally, of course, they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But what will we find to love about how cars are built and function? Will that fade as a historical note while we revel in the agency a personal car brings without some of the external costs of highways, parking lots, and petrofuels?</p>

			 <p>Dallas and Austin are the cities I&rsquo;ve spent my life in. I&rsquo;ve spent maybe three weeks of my life, total, in San Francisco and New York City. They&rsquo;re similar in that SF and NYC are both a Whole Other Thing in comparison to my Texan expectations. Indeed, they&rsquo;re global cities operating at an entirely different order of magnitude.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s long puzzled me why I find NYC less intimidating and strange than SF. I&rsquo;m starting to think its the attitudes. Walking through either town, I frequently suspect that I&rsquo;m Doing It Wrong, from where to eat to where to sleep to how to use the subway.</p>
<p>In NYC, I suspect the natives are looking on as I struggle to hail a cab or catch a train, but they are silent in their snickering about me doing it wrong.</p>
<p>SF feels much more in your face, eager to tell you &ldquo;You have done it wrong and you should feel bad&rdquo;, from the subway systems to the tech bubble.</p>
<p>San Francisco very much remains a frontier town. You move there to make your fortune, to burn bright and &ldquo;compress your career into several years&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s at the same time fractured by law (the city has three different transit systems, all using different tokens last time I visited) and lawless (Uber and Airbnb in particular are about landgrabs before the law can catch up with technology). It&rsquo;s at once a global city and embarrassingly self-centered.</p>

<p>Fewer developers would prefer to create their own world, building up tools and libraries to suit. They select a few first principles and build their own world. They&rsquo;re the bebop jazz musician, eschewing big band gigs and music people can dance to to create their own intellectual world. These are the Library people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Framework person. The allure of Library people sometimes tempts me after I look at a beautifully-restored car or a well-structured song.

			 <p>It&rsquo;s commonly held, and pretty much true, that ideas are shallow and execution is depth. That is, the former is nothing without lots and lots of the latter.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s set aside how &ldquo;execution over ideas&rdquo; is used as a bludgeon for a moment. I think there&rsquo;s possibly a case where &ldquo;execution <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AND<!-- raw HTML omitted --> idea&rdquo; is a viable recipe for success.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a Wild West, converting the minimal version of the idea to an executed offering can be all you need to succeed. Temporarily.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re always moving from emerging market to emerging market, you&rsquo;re betting not on your ability to execute, but your ability to identify the next market. You&rsquo;re OK with fast followers building on your idea, iterating on it, and establishing themselves as the market matures. That&rsquo;s OK, because you&rsquo;ve already moved on to the next market.</p>
<p>So the risk here isn&rsquo;t execution, but idea/market selection. When you&rsquo;re first, it&rsquo;s slightly OK to ship with a product that will be viewed as laughable once the market is mature. 75% idea, 25% execution.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re second, seventh, or seventeenth, you had better execute on the idea, the business, and the culture you build. It&rsquo;s 95% execution, 5% idea.</p>

			 <p>Nearly fourteen years ago, I graduated college and found my first full-time, non-apprentice-y job writing code. When I wrote code, these were the sorts of things I worried about:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Today, I know a lot more things. I did some things right and a lot of things wrong. Now when I write code, these are the sorts of things I worry about:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Half of those concerns are about empathy. They&rsquo;re only a sampling of all the things I&rsquo;ve learned I should care about as I write code, but I think the ratio holds up. As I get better and better at programming, as my career proceeds, I need more empathy towards my future self and my teammates.</p>
<p>Further, that empathy needs to extend towards those who are less experienced or haven&rsquo;t learned the precise things I&rsquo;ve learned. What works for me, the solutions that are obvious to me, the problems to steer clear of, none of that is in someone else&rsquo;s head. I can&rsquo;t give them a book, wait three weeks, and expect them to share my strengths and wisdoms.</p>
<p>That means, when I advise those who listen or steer a team that allows me to steer it, I have to make two camps happy. On one hand, I have to make a decision that is true to what I think is important and prudent. On the other hand, I have to lay out guidelines that lead the listener or teammate towards what I think is important or prudent without micromanagement, strict rules, and other forms of negative reinforcement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy, for me, to just hope that everyone is like me and work under that assumption. But it&rsquo;s much better, and highly worthwhile, to figure out how to help friends and teammates to level up on their own. It requires a whole lot of empathy, and the discipline to use it instead of impatience. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Worth it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>There was an extension point, but I missed it.</p>
<p>I was adding functionality to a class. I needed to add something that seemed a little different, but not too far afield, from what the existing code was doing. So I came up with a good name, wrote a method, and went about my day.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, trying to understand an obscure path through this particular class, I found the extension point I should have been using. On one hand, eureka! On the other hand, why didn’t I notice this in the first place?</p>
<p>Did I not consider the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->open/closed principle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> enough? Perhaps my “modification” sense should have tingled, sending me to create a new object to encapsulate the behavior with.</p>
<p>Was the extension point <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hidden by indirection<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? Perhaps the change going into an ActiveRecord model through me off; I was doing as you’d normally do in a model. I wasn’t expecting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->another<!-- raw HTML omitted --> layer of abstraction.</p>
<p>Were my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->changes too scattered<!-- raw HTML omitted --> amongst many files? I had modifications in a half-dozen files, plus their tests. It’s possible I was juggling too many things.</p>
<p>Probably it’s all of these things. Lesson learned: when <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> get to feeling clever and add a handy extension point to make the next person’s job easier, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->advertise<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that extension point and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->make it clear this is probably where they want to make their change<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Perhaps there&rsquo;s a benign explanation for Paul Ryan appearing to have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cut off his phones<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Anecdotally, it does not seem GOP Congresscritters are putting much effort into their voicemails or phone lines. I called my representative, Lamar Smith, yesterday afternoon, incensed that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he had suggested we listen to Trump and not the media<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Both his DC and Austin voicemails were full. I was able to get through this morning and spoke with a staffer who was dismissive but polite.</p>
<p>This practice of neglecting voicemails and only dismissively answering phones during office hours is appalling. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->job<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of our Congress is to represent us. They cannot do that job if they aren&rsquo;t taking every voicemail, phone, and email into account. Very rarely do I get the feeling Congress wants to even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->appear<!-- raw HTML omitted --> they are doing their job.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t answer my work email, I&rsquo;d lose my job. But Congresspeople don&rsquo;t lose their jobs except for during an election or certain kinds of partisan maneuverings.</p>
<p>Fire Congress anyway. I&rsquo;ve started with the phones and a whole lot of pent-up frustration. Maybe <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the infernal hell of fax machines is next<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Journalism is trying very hard to do better, but still failing America. Media is covering <!-- raw HTML omitted -->politics<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and not “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->We, the people<!-- raw HTML omitted -->”.</p>
<p>Take the coverage of the Republican attempt to neuter congressional oversight and subsequent retreat amidst tremendous scrutiny. Coverage typically read “Donald Trump tweeted about this and by the way a ton of people called their congressperson.” The coverage is focused on what a person in power says. A fascination with celebrity and power.</p>
<p>It’s not focused on the readers, or the people who bear the actions of politicians. Certainly not the disadvantaged who can’t even keep up with politics because they have neither a) the money for a newspaper subscription or b) the time to follow it all between multiple jobs and possibly a family.</p>
<p>It’s focused on what politicians are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->saying<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the people want. It’s easy to get a politician to talk about this. That’s part of their job now, skating the public discourse towards the laws <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they<!-- raw HTML omitted --> want to pass.</p>
<p>It’s focused on what think tanks want to talk about. Those talking heads on TV and think pieces on the opinion pages? It’s easy to get those people to talk because they’re paid to do those things by giant lobbies and interest groups. They’re paid to get in front of people and tell them what laws they should want.</p>
<p>Journalism should counteract these extensions of the corporate state. When a politician, funded by a lobby, says “the people want affordable health care”, a print or television journalist should say “and here’s what three people not involved in politics actually said”. Maybe they’ll agree with their politicians, maybe they won’t!</p>
<p>When a politician says “we should lower taxes on the top tax bracket”, media should follow up with that that means. Who exactly gets that tax break? Will actually benefit other people? What do people who don’t benefit from that tax break gain or lose because of it.</p>
<p>The next news cycle will come up, the politicians will say one thing. The truth and tradeoffs will reflect another truth. The journalists will go out there and talk about the tradeoffs and what people think now. And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->then<!-- raw HTML omitted --> maybe we’ll get a more educated society.</p>
<p>Likely this means the sports and entertainment pages have to subsidize the political coverage. Or we need to start recognizing pieces stuffed with quotes from think tanks and politicians as “advertorial” and not news.</p>
<p>Regardless, political journalism as zero-sum entertainment has to go.</p>

			 <p>It seems like some folks don’t like music with a lot of studio work. Overproduced, they call it. Maybe this is a relic of the days when producers weren’t a creative force on par with the actual performers and artists.</p>
<p>I don’t know, because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I love overproduced music<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Phil Spector, “Wall of Sound”? Bring it. Large band efforts like “Sir Duke”, “You’re not from Texas”, or “Good Vibrations”? Love it. Super-filtered drum sound? Gotta have it.</p>
<p>It probably has everything to do with, at one point, wanting to pursue a career as a double bassist in symphony orchestras. The pieces I loved the most were the big Romantic tone poems and symphonies with a chorus. Hundreds of people, dozens of unique parks, all playing at the same time, often loudly. It’s the essence of overproduced.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s a curious thing. When I hear “Wouldn’t it be nice?” in my head, it’s much bigger and Wagnerian than it is on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pet Sounds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The pedal tone is bigger and more prominent, the first note after the guitar intro is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->massive<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Maybe I’m just projecting my interpretation onto the song.</p>
<p>Contrast to “Good Vibrations”. There’s always more going on than I remember. Vocal parts, instruments. Sooooo good.</p>
<p>Outside of Brian Wilson, I’ve noticed Jeff Lynne is amongst “the overproducers”. Especially, apparently, how he thins out drum sounds. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Love it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

			 <p>Earlier last year, I gave myself two challenges:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Of course, I was almost immediately stymied on the second one:</p>
<p>[code lang=text]
sudo dtruss -t write ruby -e &quot;puts 'hi!'&quot;
Password:</p>
<p>dtrace: failed to execute ruby: dtrace cannot control executables signed with restricted entitlements
[/code]</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->dtruss<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the dtrace-powered macOS-equivalent of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strace<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It is very cool when it works. But. It turns out Apple has a thing that protects users from code injection hijinks, which makes dtrace not work. You can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->turn it off<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but that requires hijinks of its own.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->did<!-- raw HTML omitted --> end up troubleshooting some production problems via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strace<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lsof<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That was fun, very educational, and slightly helpful. Would do again.</p>
<p>I did <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> end up using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gdb<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to poke inside any Ruby programs. On the whole, this is probably for the better.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was more successful in using Ruby as a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gasp<!-- raw HTML omitted --> scripting language. I gave myself some principles for writing Ruby automation:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>These were good principles.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At first I tried writing Ruby scripts as command suites via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sub<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sub<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a really cool idea, very easy to start with, makes discovery of functionality easy for others, and Just Works. You should try it some time!</p>
<p>That said, often I didn’t need anything fancy. Just run a few commands. Sometimes I even wrote those with bash!</p>
<p>But if I needed to do something less straightforward, I used template like this:</p>
<p>[code lang=text]
#!/usr/bin/env ruby</p>
<p>HELP = &lt;&lt;-HELP
test # Run the test suite
test ci # Run test with CI options enabled
test acceptance # Run acceptance tests (grab a coffee&hellip;.)
HELP</p>
<p>module Test
module_function</p>
<p>def test
<code>rspec spec</code>
end</p>
<h1 id="-more-methods-for-each-subcommand">&hellip; more methods for each subcommand</h1>
<p>end</p>
<p>if __FILE == $0
cmd = ARGV.first</p>
<p>case cmd
when &quot;ci&quot;
Test.ci</p>
<h1 id="-a-block-for-each-subcommand">&hellip; a block for each subcommand</h1>
<p>else
Test.test
end
end
[/code]</p>
<p>This was a good, friction-eliminating starting skeleton.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The template I settled on eliminated the friction of starting something new. I’d write down the subcommands or workflow I imagined I needed and get started. I wrote several scripts, delete or consolidated a few of them after a while, and still use a few of them daily.</p>
<p>If you’re using a “scripting” language to build apps and have never tried using it to “script” things I “recommend” you try it!</p>

			 <p>I already wrote about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cars as appliances or objects<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I found this earlier germ of the idea in my drafts:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The weird thing about e.g. BMW, Porsche, or Ferrari is how much enthusiasts know about them. The history, the construction, the internal model numbers, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the stories<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I suspect you can tell a prestige BMW owner from an enthusiast BMW owner if they can tell you the internal model number of their car.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My first thought, when I came across this, was this is a pretty good bit of projection and rationalization on my part ;) But it’s not hard to look into the fandom of any of those ostensibly-prestige brands like BMW or Porsche and find communities that refer to BMWs not as 3- or 5-series but as E90s or E34s (mine is an F30) and Porsches as 986 or 996 instead of the 911 marketing number. So I’m at least a little right about this!</p>
<p>I will never experience driving the majority of cars out there. I may never know how an old BMW compares to a newer one or properly hear an old Ferrari V-12. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted --> partake of the enthusiasm about their history, engineering, and idiosyncrasies.

			 <p>I miss the blogging scene circa 2001-2006. This was an era of near-peak enthusiasm for me. One of those moments where a random rock was turned over and what lay underneath was fascinating, positive, energizing, captivating, and led me to a better place in my life and career.</p>
<p>As is noted by many notable bloggers, those days are gone. Blogs are not quite what they used to be. People, lots of them!, do social media differently now.</p>
<p>Around 2004, amidst the decline of peer-to-peer technologies, I had a hunch that decentralized technology was going to lose out to centralization. Lo and behold, Friendster then MySpace then Facebook then Twitter made this real. People, I think, will always look to a Big Name first and look to run their own infrastructure nearly last.</p>
<p>In light of that, I still think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the lost infrastructure of social media<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is worth considering. As we stare down the barrel of a US administration that is likely far less benevolent with its use of an enormous propaganda and surveillance mechanism, should we swim upstream of the ease of centralization and decentralize again?</p>
<p>Consider this chart identifying community and commercially run infrastructure that used to exist and what has, in some cases, succeeded it:</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_3832&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;796&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Connective tissue, then and now[/caption]</p>
<p>I look over that chart and think, yeah a lot of this would be cool to build again.</p>
<p>Would people gravitate towards it? Maybe.</p>
<p>Could it help pop filter bubbles, social sorting, fake news and trust relationships? Doesn’t seem worth doing if it can’t.</p>
<p>Do people want to run their identity separate of the Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn behemoth? I suspect what we saw as a blog back then is now a “pro-sumer” application, a low cost way for writers, analysts, and creatives to establish themselves.</p>
<p>Maybe Twitter and Facebook are the perfect footprint for someone who just wants to air some steam about their boss, politics, or a fellow parent? It’s OK if people want to express their personality and opinions in someone else’s walled garden. I think what we learned in 2016 is that the walled gardens are more problematic than merely commercialism, though.</p>
<p>That seems pessimistic. And maybe missing the point. You can’t bring back the 2003-6 heyday of blogging a decade later. You have to make something else. It has to fit the contemporary needs and move us forward. It has to again capture the qualities of fascinating, positive, energizing, captivating, and leading to a better place.</p>
<p>I hope we figure it out and have another great idea party.</p>

			 <p>Mercedes (is it ok if I call you MB?), I think we need to talk. You’re doing great in Formula 1, congratulations on that! That said, you’ve gone in a weird direction with your passenger car dashboards. I suspect there are five different teams competing to win with these dashboards and I don’t think anyone, especially this car enthusiast, is winning overall.</p>
<p>Here’s your current entry-level SUV, the GLA. If my eye is correct, this is one of your more dated dash designs:</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_3827&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;634&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> All the buttons![/caption]</p>
<p>Back in the day, I think, you had someone on staff at MB whose primary job was to make sure your dashboards had at least 25 buttons on them. This was probably a challenging job before the advent of the in-car cellular phone. However, once those became common, that was 12 easy buttons if you just throw a dial pad onto the dash. And you did!</p>
<p>So it’s easy to identify this as an older design from the dozens  (43) of buttons. But the age of this design also shows from the LCD. One, it’s somewhat small. Two, and more glaringly, you simply tacked the LCD onto the dashboard. What happened here? Did you run out of time?</p>
<p>I think you can do better. The eyeball vents are nice though!</p>
<p>Now let’s look at a slightly more modern, and much further upscale, design. Your AMG GT coupe:</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_3828&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;673&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> All the suede[/caption]</p>
<p>OK so you lost most of the buttons in favor of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bigger, chunkier<!-- raw HTML omitted --> buttons. That’s good! You also made a little scoop in the dash for the LCD. That’s progress, but the placement still feels awkward. I know that’s where all your luxury car friends put the LCD now, but you’re so dominant in F1, maybe you can do better here too?</p>
<p>Can we take a moment to talk about the interactions a little? Your take on the rotary control is a little weird. You’ve got one, and it’s got a little hand rest on top of it. That seems good. But then the hand rest is also a touch interface for scribbling letters? Seems weird! I’ve never used that, but I’m a little skeptical.</p>
<p>Next, you’ve gone through some weird stuff with your shifters. You had a really lovely gated shifter on the S-class couple as long ago as the early 90’s! Lately you’ve tried steering column shifters, and now it seems you’ve settled on a soap-shaped chunk of metal that you move up and down to change directions and put it in park. I feel like you should give up the physical shifter thing and just go with (you’re gonna like this) more buttons.</p>
<p>My parting thought on the GT’s interior is this: width. Your designs impart a sense of tremendous girth in the dash, making the car feel bigger. We’ll come back to that immediately…</p>
<p>Finally, one of your most recent designs, the E-class sedan:</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_3829&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;867&rdquo;]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> All the pixels![/caption]</p>
<p>Again with a regal sense of width. Personally, I don’t like it. It makes your car seem like a giant sofa.</p>
<p>You are making great progress on reducing the number of buttons. Again, kudos.</p>
<p>OK, clearly you got a great deal on LCD panels. Plus, an almost equally good deal on eyeball vents. Good for you!</p>
<p>Also you put an analog clock on the dash. So that’s nice.</p>
<p>I don’t think we’re going to like this giant piece of software and glass thing for very long. Did you see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Her<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? There are hardly any displays in it. All the computers are somehow <!-- raw HTML omitted -->inhabited<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by the characters, either by talking to them or interacting within a projection. Why take one of your classic instrument clusters, make that an LCD, and occasionally project information onto the windshield if the driver or passenger needs to see it there? Just a thought!</p>
<p>I’m a little split on the design of your wheel there. It’s nice that technically it’s a 3-spoke design but really, if you count, it’s 4 spokes. The lamest number of spokes. Perhaps with the split you were trying to add more negative space and perhaps evoke a very old, SL-like 2-spoke design? That’s a nice gesture, but I think you missed here. Surely you could engineer a straight-up 2-spoke wheel?</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

			 <p>Sometimes I look over the options and constraints to choose something suboptimal. I have to pick the least-bad solution.</p>
<p>I recently chose a least-bad way to write a test. In a Rails app, the most sensible thing to solve my problem was something like this:</p>
<p>[code lang=text]
def propagate_from_child_to_parent
model_parents.find_each(&amp;:do_a_sideeffect)
end
[/code]</p>
<p>In the test, I ended up having to write this assertion</p>
<p>[code lang=text]
expect_any_instance_of(ModelParents).to receive(:do_a_sideeffect)
[/code]</p>
<p>This kind of stub and assertion is clearly a smell. But, consider the alternatives:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the end, it felt like the shady mock+assertion was the best choice. Using that particular assertion says “slow down and pay attention, a special thing is happening here”. It’s not something I want to do every time, but it was the least bad solution in this context.</p>

			 <p>Our programming languages are often structured around the problem domain of compilers and the archaic (for most of us) task of converting things people understand to a thing the computer can execute.</p>
<p>Why don’t our languages have deeper support for the ways we reason about problem domains or the ways we struggle to reason. For example, why aren’t state machines and checking their sanity (or marking their unsoundness) a thing in pretty much any language?</p>
<p>The unhelpful answer is “because you can write a state machine in library code”. Which leads me to ask, why don’t we have popular state machine clones? Why is there no xUnit or Sinatra of state machines that is widely cloned to fresh and exciting languages?</p>
<p>The cynical answer is “because many programmers don’t want to think that hard”. The optimistic answer is that there’s room for someone to capture this problem space as well as xUnit did for programmer testing or Sinatra did for turning URL-like strings into method calls.

			 <p>My favorite advice on the topic of method visibility (i.e. public vs. private) comes from Python creator Guido van Rossum. It goes something like “we’re all adults here” and says it’s not really a necessary thing for compilers/runtimes to hide methods from specific callers. Don’t go mucking around in other object’s implementations. I still think that’s mostly right.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Except<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, coming up to speed on a new code base is vastly easier when there’s some delineation of the waterline between an object’s public API which it expects other objects to use and its private implementation which it does not. It tells me a) the private methods are open for change and refactoring and b) below the private “waterline”, don’t bother going any deeper when spelunking to figure out how this program works.</p>
<p>In a new or strange codebase, every little bit of tractability helps.</p>

			 <p>A few years ago, I was re-infected with enthusiasm for cars. I came upon <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One Car to Do It All<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and found a new reason to obsess over cars.</p>
<p>I read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Car and Driver<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Road and Track<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a teenager. I was excited by the agency that cars bring (who isn’t?). It was a fun thing for me to nerd out about: technical specifications , comparing feature lists, and of course benchmarks! There was also a slight bit of romance to automotive journalism, ostensibly all writers traveling the country (or world) driving neat cars in beautiful places, often quite quickly.</p>
<p>Now, I’m taken by the history of specific manufacturers and how older models of cars became the current models. The technology and coordination needed to produce the modern car appeals to my technological side. The shape of cars new and old is a fun subjective conversation (e.g. are exterior about form or function?).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Most people do not view cars this way. They are automotive pragmatists. They want a car like they want a refrigerator or washing machine. The car is an appliance. It takes you from where you are to where you want to go without drama, in a modicum of comfort. The quality of the steering feedback, the particulars of the engine, or the predecessor of the car from two decades ago are nothing. The optimization is all around cost of ownership and utility.</p>
<p>(For the sake of symmetry I feel compelled to write another couple paragraphs on automotive pragmatism. But, there’s really nothing else to say. It’s pragmatic through and through.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A curious thing happens when my car enthusiasm interacts with pragmatic car owners. Some of them will encourage me to talk about my enthusiasm. Mostly, it seems a little awkward, as though they’re afraid I somehow experience cars in a better way than they do. This is totally not the case, I can’t even really drive a stick!</p>
<p>In a way its not actually that curious. Car enthusiasm and the cars enthusiasts own correlate highly with elitism, which <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is by definition<!-- raw HTML omitted --> intimidating. But it does make me wish I had a shorthand for “I drive this car because its interesting to me, but I won’t judge your car, now tell me what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you’re<!-- raw HTML omitted --> enthusiastic about that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> don’t understand”.</p>

			 <p>A few folks suggested I try lazy enumerables to make my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extremely chained<!-- raw HTML omitted --> style practical. I was curious about the actual costs of my style, so it&rsquo;s time for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lies and microbenchmarks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->! Turns out naively chaining a bunch of maps together isn&rsquo;t very costly, so go with that to start.</p>
<p>Lazy came in much slower than consolidating the logic in one loop or chaining them without lazy. I thought, I must not have used lazy properly. Turns out, I&rsquo;m probably showing that laziness isn&rsquo;t well suited to iterating over collections without an early termination clause (e.g. a take, first, or find) and that for small collections (like an 87-line /etc/passwd), the cost of the lazy plumbing can noticeably outweigh the work done inside the loops.

			 <p>Lately, I’m doing a weird thing when writing Ruby code. I’m trying to only put one idea or action per line. I’m not sure about it yet.</p>
<p>Here’s what a method to fetch item-y things might look like:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For the sake of comparison, here’s how I may have written that method a couple years ago:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I like that the pace of reading the first example is even. You don’t arrive upon some monster line of code that does a multiple things. You don’t have to unpack what’s happening in a situation where you’re calling <!-- raw HTML omitted -->f(g(h(some_args)))<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It makes moving lines of code around much simpler because each one is only dependent on what comes before, and not what happens <!-- raw HTML omitted -->inside<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s a little easier to write a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->three-part method<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I really like.</p>
<p>But still, I hesitate. My methods end up about 50% longer. Breaking up the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Enumerable<!-- raw HTML omitted --> transformations into multiple loops instead of one loop doing a bunch of work is probably pretty slow. I have to come up with a lot of names (which is, I think a net good), some of which end up a little redundant.</p>
<p>I’ll let you know how it goes. It may not even survive code review, who knows!</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This reminds me of Developer Experience. “Developer experience” is a weird word right now, but it’s becoming table stakes for success. It’s a design discipline. It’s considering the form <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> function of code. It&rsquo;s the opposite of attempting to learn C ;)</p>

			 <p>Slight rant: versioning a (REST) API inflicts upon you a confluence of factors that will lead to pain no matter what you do.</p>
<p>You’re going to need to version things, which opens you to bikeshedding which True Scotsman approach to REST versioning you’ll use. Once you’ve expended tons of effort on how clients should specify which version they want (i.e. once you’ve just barely started), now you need to figure out how to make that work in your code. Which, after you’re done parsing the HTTP request (the easy part!), is almost certainly going to lead to some unruly layer(s) of indirection. At which point you’re going to hate life and never want to introduce another version ever again. And you won’t even be close to finished.</p>
<p>I hope that, between <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JSON API<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GraphQL<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, letting the client specify what they want ends up proving way better than relying on the server to carefully (or possibly carelessly) hand craft just the right data for the client.</p>

			 <p>Software design has probably been broken from the start. The earliest business software, machine language encoded to punch cards, was more about fiddling registers and managing memory locations than doing arithmetic or implementing business logic. Even after you fast forward to Unix and compiled languages, software is still more about managing heap memory and arcane details like file or error pointers than it is about business logic.</p>
<p>Fast forward again to the first web apps and it seems like there’s an opportunity to put business logic in the center and the incidental complexity of the computer on the outsides. Alas, when web apps took off, most of their logic was written in scripting languages which often trade organizing code along boundaries for the thrill of just getting stuff done. Sometimes I don’t think we’ve outgrown that urge.</p>

			 <p>Let’s talk about boundaries in programs. I need them, otherwise programs grow increasingly inscrutable and impossible to change. A lack of boundaries is nearly as bad as spaghetti code; i.e. it’s really bad.</p>
<p>But, too many boundaries can also make a program inscrutable. To the absurd, a program composed entirely of black boxes each of a single narrow function and behavior is all indirection. Indirection is a cost I pay when I introduce boundaries, e.g. “Your princess is in another castle.” I want to have just the right number of boundaries; not too few, not too many.</p>
<p>Further, I want to avoid establishing the wrong boundaries if I can. Boundaries are hard to move around; creating them is an implicit act of making some kinds of changes <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more<!-- raw HTML omitted --> difficult. Awkward boundaries make it difficult to write correct code; hurried developers will yield to the temptation to circumvent the boundary. If you do manage to identify an awkward boundary and correct it, you’ll have some temporary churn in your program while you rejigger the boundary and the code on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->both<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sides of it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the right boundaries are wonderful. They create leverage for the developers working on both sides of the boundaries. They get more done, only needing to know about the boundary and not what lies on the other side. Establishing good boundaries is the first step towards encapsulation and abstraction.</p>
<p>We used to make boundaries from packages and libraries. Now we have added out-of-process services, message passing, and infrastructure as boundaries. This will probably turn out as a net benefit, but right now we’re chasing novelty, blog posts, and conference talks at the expense of increased complexity. We aren’t really “engineering” our boundaries.</p>
<p>Creating boundaries too eagerly increases the odds of imposing the wrong boundaries and churning on said boundaries. Creating boundaries too lazily imposes a high cost of change to create those boundaries once you discover them and accept the implementation challenge.</p>
<p>My favorite kind of boundary is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bounded context<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Its a wonderful epiphany that we don’t all have to agree on the precise definition of words and responsibilities if we can agree where the fences (boundaries) go.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gary Bernhardt has nice things to say about boundaries<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you like this, you’ll love his ideas.</p>

			 <p>This morning I walked a half mile, not too far, to a neighborhood coffee shop. I had two breakfast tacos and a sweet-flavored latte.</p>
<p>I can choose to walk, and take a Sunday morning (really, a whole weekend) to myself because I went to college, fooled around with computers a bunch, and happened upon a time of tremendous income growth for people who fooled around with computers a lot.</p>
<p>On the way, I walked down a well-maintained and safe sidewalk in an neighborhood in the middle of teardowns and gentrification. At one point, a small branch had grown over the sidewalk. Not big enough to walk around entirely, just the right size to push away.</p>
<p>But then, like a miracle, the wind blew just so and pushed the branch out of my way. It was like nature’s automatic sliding door.</p>
<p>Seems that’s a pretty good way of summing up the Easy Mode of Life that is being a professional white guy.</p>

			 <p>Doubt mongering. It’s a thing that happens because egos are fragile. Some doubts I’ve heard or uttered myself in the past month:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>They’re FUD and they work off cognitive biases. When someone’s trying to vent, angle into a conversation, or show how smart they are, doubt mongering can happen.</p>

<p>Say we’re talking about Swagger, for example. Most human endeavors are flawed. It’s perfectly legitimate to say “not all uses of IDLs have succeeded” and “let’s learn from past experience”. That’s a useful insight!</p>
<p>But it’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not okay<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to do so in a way that takes the energy out of the conversation.

			 <p>I was chatting about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Event Sourced<!-- raw HTML omitted --> data models with a pal last week. He is really taken by the idea and excited that perhaps its a “next big thing” in data modeling. Regretfully, I have an adverse reaction to “next big thing” thinking and pointed out that Event Sourced data models are more complex than the equivalent third-normal form data model. Thus, I said, tooling and education need to set in before Event Sourcing could achieve broad impact.</p>
<p>(Before I proceed, I need to put forth a lament of vocabulary. Events, in this context, are not fine-grained language constructs like in a continuation-passing-style asynchronous system. They are business events, a sale or page impression, or technical events, a request or cache hit. These are not callbacks.)</p>
<p>That said, there’s a few strings to pull from Event Sourcing that seem like possible trends:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In particular, the case for synchronization is when things started clicking for me. Hat tip to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Nolen’s talk on Om Next<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (start at 17:12) for this. As we continue building native and mobile web apps that are frequently disconnected, we may need an additional tool to augment resource-based workflows. In the same way that perhaps Event Sourcing is something we build as an extension of third-normal form data models, I’ll bet event logs as APIs will pop up more often. But we may see event logs entirely usurping resource workflows. Why implement consuming a log <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> implementing updates via REST when you could write a log <!-- raw HTML omitted -->producer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and ship new events off to the server?</p>
<p>The developer impedance mismatch I’m finding with message logs is request-reply thinking. There’s a temptation to recreate REST semantics in Kafka topics. If a consumer fails to process a message, does it stop processing entirely, skip the message, discard the message? Does it notify another consumer via a separate topic, or does it phone home to its developers via an error notification? I haven’t found a satisfying answer to this, but I suspect its a matter of time, education, and tooling.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Better understand <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Encapsulation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I can’t 😍 this article enough:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Useless datapoint: my personal maximum is around three thousand lines of code, or 4–6 weeks of clean-slate effort.</p>
<p>So maybe I need to start encapsulating once I reach that limit?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This has been bugging me for a while. Encapsulation is treated as an unquestionable good by many developers. To question encapsulation is to adopt the opposite, that design isn’t worthwhile.</p>
<p>But it’s a tradeoff! Introducing encapsulation incurs a temporary increase in the net complexity of a system. Over the course of a tactical refactoring of methods and classes, the increased complexity is only observable by one or two developers doing the work.</p>
<p>But, if services are encapsulation (they are!), then rearranging the pieces will leave you paying for the increased complexity for days, weeks, months. Now the encapsulation takes on real costs: the risk of completing it, the burden of explaining to others what you’re doing, etc. That encapsulation better be worth it and not just a hunch!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My experience is that encapsulation, if it happens at all, starts off shallow. Real encapsulation, where a developer can treat it as a black box, never needing to peak inside to understand the mechanisms or in/out problems, is rare. It takes the best designers of software to achieve it.</p>
<p>We should all be so bold as to attempt building encapsulations of that quality, but not so proud to think that we succeed at it even half the time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I feel like prefactoring a program or architecture only increases the complexity growth rate of small systems. A dominant factor in complexity is communication and coordination cost. If you start off with ten classes instead of three, or three services instead of one, you haven’t tripled your complexity, you’ve squared it (or worse).</p>
<p>I’m all for minimal solutions and fighting to keep things small, but not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at the cost of incurring large coordination overhead<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Emphasis mine. In a successful system, size and complexity are nearly unavoidable. Almost every “best practice” and “leading edge approach” we know of is contextual and expresses trade-offs. Thus I’m left agreeing that the unsatisfying, hand-wavy craft of “careful, dedicated, disciplined work” is the principle most likely to generate code that’s improves (rather than regresses) over its lifetime.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->An interview with John Allspaw<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, on Etsy infrastructure and operations:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When you have a conversation that unnecessarily paints the discussion as, “Are you micro-services or are you a monolith?” then it wipes away all of the context-specificity. Which you actually have no real way of talking inspecifics.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Compared to the previous buzzword, SOA, what does microservices mean? As far I can tell, its two things:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Context-specificity is the important part. I’ve been reading David Byrne’s <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How Music Works<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and he spends the first chapter entirely on how the performance venue (a savannah, a noisy club, an austere concert hall) puts its mark on the music that is performed there (percussion oriented, loud and compressed, or quiet and precise).</p>
<p>In architecture, context is also king. Building and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->deploying<!-- raw HTML omitted --> services is different at Heroku, Netflix, Facebook, and the place where you work. You can build services of varying size and complexity anywhere on any stack. What the team, culture, and organization prefers is the real determinant.</p>
<p>I find it useful to read about other people’s service architectures to learn what works elsewhere. Even better if they describe the context they built that service architecture in. But <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it is always foolish cargo-culting to attempt to replicate another team’s architecture without the team and organizational context in which it was born<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>When it comes to Twitter, things can get out of hand fast. Setting aside the hostile environment some people face when they participate in Twitter (which is setting aside a doozy!), it helps to have a few defense mechanism for what is appearing in your stream.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I evaluate each potential follow by the rule of &ldquo;smart and happy&rdquo;. Which doesn&rsquo;t mean smart, angry people are automatically off the list. But, they have to show a really unique intelligence to get past my emotional filter. I made a graphic to boil down my &ldquo;should follow?&rdquo; decision:</p>

			 <p>It’s easy to complain about PHP. For instance, why didn’t they choose ☃ as their namespace resolution operator?! As a developer with lofty opinions, I’m not a big fan of PHP. To me, it’s an argument against allowing accretion to determine the design of a system. I don’t think it’s controversial to call the PHP language, core library, and ecosystem “inconsistent” and “a matter of curious histories”. A language feature here, a library function there, year over year, and you’ve got a “quaint” design. Yes, those are scare-quotes.</p>
<p>Whenever I feel a big rant about PHP shortcomings approaching, I try remember a few important facets of its success:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Fast forward to today. PHP is still doing fine, though lots of people switched to Ruby or Python many moons ago, depending on personality type. And lots of those have since moved on to other things. The technology hype curve is an overlapping, ongoing thing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Of those that switched, many ended up with JavaScript, in the guise of browser-side frameworks or server-side Node (and its ilk). I think there’s a huge opportunity here. JS is not without flaws, like PHP. But its sort of backed into really broad reach. Embedded, games, applications, mobile, probably more that I don’t even know about. That could make it compelling for an even less math-y demographic of people building stuff with computers.</p>
<p>And yet, there is no single JS community. There’s browser people, there’s server people. The future may hold mobile, gaming, and device people. That creates dissonance and some uphill battles.</p>
<p>But maybe that’s the really cool part. The JavaScript <!-- raw HTML omitted -->communities<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will have to slog uphill a bit to make accessible the previously intimidating domains of mobile apps, games, and embedded software. And that could raise the boat for people who aren’t building web apps but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->could<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be building software.</p>

			 <p>The tricky thing about decomposing code into abstractions is you end up with &ldquo;functions about nothing&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ve probably seen on of these: a method or function with really vague names glommed into a utility or enumerations junk drawer. It&rsquo;s probably innocuous, but as you&rsquo;re reading code, it takes you out of your flow and forces you to think in the abstract instead of the concrete.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to guess how these things happen. Successive refactoring iterations end up pulling business logic into a pile of predicates and side-effects and separate pile of abstractions. We feel pretty good ourselves at the end of the refactoring and write a fancy blog post about it!</p>
<p>The rub is when we come back to read the code later. Its easy to find the abstraction first and get side-tracked by figuring out why it exists, the context in which it was created, and when we might use it again. This is better than predicates and side-effects interwoven. But it&rsquo;s still a problem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a salve for this. I just wanted to put the phrase &ldquo;functions about nothing&rdquo; on the internet. [SLAP BASS OUTRO RIFF PLAYS HERE]</p>

<p>Driving in Italy is totally unlike driving in America. For one thing, there are very often <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no lane markers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Occasionally a 1.5 lane road is shared by two cars moving in opposite directions. Even if there were lane markers, it’s doubtful Italian drivers would heed them. Italian traffic flows like water, always looking for shortcuts, ways to squeeze through, and running around temporary obstacles. For an American, driving in a big Italian city is a white-knuckle affair.</p>
<p>My conjecture is that the unspoken rule of Italian drivers is “never break stride”. Ease in and out of lanes, blend in at traffic circles. There’s almost a body language to Italian driving by which you can tell when someone is going to merge into your lane, when a motorbike may swerve in front of you, or when a tiny delivery van is going to blow past you on a two-lane road.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Start with the result.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I find myself mired in optimizing for short-term results that I can incrementally build upon. This is a fine tactic, especially when getting started. It’s a nice way to show progress quickly and keep making progress when rhythm matters.</p>
<p>But, it’s a tactic. To make a musical analogy, it’s how you write a song, not how you write a whole album. At some point I need a strategy, a bigger idea. I need a result in mind.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>I love to tinker with new technology. The grass is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->always<!-- raw HTML omitted --> greener with new langauges, libraries, tools, etc. I’ve learned a lot this way, and kept up with the times. I’ve got lots of surface-level experience with lots of things. But increasingly I want more experience with deeply accomplishing or understanding something.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>Driving in Italy was extremely jarring for me at first. It closely resembled chaos. Eventually, I got used to it, at small and medium scales. (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But never drive in Rome/Milan<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Now, I sort of miss driving in Italy, at least the good parts. I miss the freedom to overtake other drivers without having to swerve through lanes, and I miss not stopping at traffic signals any time there’s an intersection.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a reminder, for me, that getting out of my routine (American driving) isn’t so bad. Worth the initial shock. Maybe my routines, my tactics, my tool/library/langauge novelty seeking, were helping me along as much as constraining me.</p>
<p>Maybe the big picture result, not the iteration, is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the thing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and how you get there (highly ordered American driving or seemingly unordered Italian driving) is of less consequence.</p>

<p>The whole point of a framework is that you trade one or more axes of freedom in how you structure your program so that you can move faster writing the meaningful (unique) part of that program. To wit, the first definition I learned of a framework goes something like:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Most programs would have a boring <!-- raw HTML omitted -->main()<!-- raw HTML omitted --> anyway, so this is a great tradeoff in most cases.</p>
<p>And yet:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Where we end up is that I notice people complaining about frameworks. I think most of these are proxy complaints about someone else choosing a framework they have to live with. To their credit, some complainers are actively trying to make a better thing too. Kudos to them. To the idle complainers: cut it out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>RSpec and minitest are both frameworks in the sense that your entry point is a special class with special methods. RSpec is more frameworky in that you don’t actually write classes or methods. You use a language-y DSL to define test cases that share some aspect of scope. You can go pretty crazy in this manner. Or you can not go crazy, RSpec accomodates either style.</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been wrestling with test cases written using at least three kinds of RSpec scope and it’s driving me a little crazy. They look something like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If scoping is about answering the question “what methods are available to me on this line of code”, this code seems to have four kinds of scope:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It is at this point I try and take my own medicine and make a constructive observation rather than yelling “this sucks and someone should feel bad about it!” into the wind (i.e. Twitter).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I didn’t like RSpec at first (circa 2008), then I really liked it (circa 2010), and now I’m sort of ambivalent. The question of what RSpec exists to solve has evolved too. At first it was “hey, BDD!” and then it was a less underscore-y way to build tests and now I think it’s a tool for writing tests in a style that some prefer and some don’t. In short, the Ruby community is figuring this out and kind of storming through the awkward parts.</p>
<p>That awkward part is how I think my example test came to be so unclear. Without doing a deep archaeological dig on the code, I’m guessing this code had three phases:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I don’t blame RSpec for any of these phases. You can easily swap out the names of libraries and concepts for any other language or library and find a similar story buried in any chunk of code that’s been around for more than a year and worked on by more than one person. It’s a thing that happens to code. I’m not even sure people should feel bad about it. Mindful of cleaning it up over time, yes. Throw it all in the bin and start over, no.</p>
<p>My first temptation is to say that using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it<!-- raw HTML omitted --> one-liners is a smell. They are nice to scan through but tricky to write and trickier still to change. But I can see where a series of well-intentioned code changes compresses many structurally similar test cases down to nearly-declarative (nearly!) one-liners without much duplicate typing. I can imagine a high-functioning team writing their own matchers, carefully using one-liners, and succeeding. So this one is a word of warning and not a smell.</p>
<p>The real smell, I think, is that its really easy to have very different scopes adjacent to each other in an RSpec test file. Further, not all scope-introducing constructs look the same! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->describe/context<!-- raw HTML omitted --> introduce one kind of scope, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it<!-- raw HTML omitted --> introdues another kind of scope, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->let/subject/before<!-- raw HTML omitted --> introduce three similar but different kinds of scope, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->expects/is_expected<!-- raw HTML omitted --> look the same but have different scopes as well.</p>
<p>Even smellier is that I’m making this list from an empirical understanding and not by examining the implementation or experimenting with reduced test cases.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’m probably going to leave that code alone. Wait for a muse to strike at the same time I need to make wholesale changes.</p>
<p>People who use RSpec should feel fine about themselves. People who contributed to RSpec should feel great about themselves. People who struggle with figuring out scope in RSpec should take solace that the best of us find this stuff confusing and frustrating at times. Developers not in one of these camps should take my advice, globals are bad but a bunch of weird scoping is not great either. Everyone else can smile and nod.</p>

			 <p>Like fast food or coffee at Starbucks, maybe team leadership comes in three sizes.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Extra large leadership<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. “This is what you’re doing. Make it happen, let me know when it’s done.” The old school, top-down approach. This is what I thought all management was like many moons ago. In my experience this is only useful when people need to think only about what they’re doing, not why they’re doing it or how they do it. Leadership sets the work, lays out the exact process for doing that work, and closely monitors the work as its done. See also: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taylorism<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Large leadership<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. “Here are some things that need doing. Do one of them, keep me posted.” This is where I think cohesive teams of knowledge workers should aim to be. Leadership lays out the tasks to be done, makes the work to do clear, and gets out of the way. Luckily this is a lot more frequent lately, but probably not so much in part-time labor. Leadership still monitors the flow of work, but not overtly as in Taylorism.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Medium leadership<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. “Do what you think is most important. Let me know how to remove obstacles.” I suspect most leaders really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->want<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get here, but are constrained, imagined or in reality, by some organizational detail. It’s definitely where <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> want to be in leadership style. High trust in the team, high trust in the leadership. Lots of unicorn dust.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I think some teams and projects require large leadership and some require medium leadership. Some people want a little structure to their work, some projects require well-defined milestones to rally around. Other people can effectively guide themselves to useful outcomes, other projects are less about the milestone and more about the journey.</p>

			 <p>My pal <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brandon Hays<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I are fond of noting that projects have a very limited tolerance for the risk of picking a novel technology or approach. Thus, they should <!-- raw HTML omitted -->intentionally<!-- raw HTML omitted --> choose <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> thing to break ground on: database, language, domain model, testing methodology, design paradigm, etc.</p>
<p>Turns out, that’s sort of a thing in social psychology too:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Turns out this is strongly related to leadership, group expectations, and conformism. That explains a lot of my experience. Those most interested in trying novel approaches are often those who let expectations and conformism take a backseat to trying something new or breaking the mold.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is necessarily good or bad; it’s fine and healthy for a project to choose to vary from the norm in some way. Even better, manage those variances so if things don’t go to plan, you can back them out and keep rolling. But, it doesn’t hurt to consider varying in ways that are likely to yield more “credits” amongst your team.</p>

			 <p>Let me start with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a quote from wonderful person James Edward Gray II<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ve had great success with this approach as well. I probably read the majority of Rails, the source of every RubyGem I used, and chunks of Ruby’s standard library in my first few years of working with Ruby. I picked up new tricks, figured out how things worked, and got myself out of a lot of tricky corners by reading code.</p>
<p>That we can do this is, to me, the real wonder of working with an open source stack. If I’m curious, I can dig into the framework, language, database, compiler, and operating system I’m using. If something goes weird, I can dig into it. I probably won’t end up changing or fixing anything below my app in the stack, but the ability to peel back the layers is a huge deal.</p>
<p>Given the choice of digging into why software sometimes goes weird and complaining or giving up, always chose digging into the source to see what’s going on.</p>
<p>When you work with open source software, you can always chose to figure out what&rsquo;s going on around your app. Eating at the source code buffet is awesome!</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Let me talk about vacation computing. The prime directive of vacation computing is that you should compute on vacation as little as possible. Neglect your email, abandon your social mediums. Don’t do the things you normally do, regardless of how computery your regular work is.</p>
<p>From there, it follows that your vacation computer should basically not be a computer. That means smartphones, tablets, and book readers are the only options. But smartphones are pretty much synonymous with social media, so they aren’t really viable as a vacation computer (though you probably want it anyway because they’re a superpower). Tablets are nearly computers now, so that’s not viable either.</p>
<p>It follows that a book reader is the only acceptable vacation computer.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Let me talk about disposable computing now. We put a lot of important stuff on our computers these days. Important passwords, legal documents, email, family pictures, private pictures, computer games, purchased and bespoke music, Hollywood and home video, etc. Sometimes those computers are in our pockets, sometimes they’re on our laps and coffee tables, and occasionally you might still find them on our desks!</p>
<p>For the drama and heartbreak that can occur when we lose these computers, we take astoundingly bad care of them. We don’t back them up, we reuse passwords. A moment without wireless networking is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the worst<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and yet we don’t take steps to prevent even more dramatic losses due to password breaches and storage failure.</p>
<p>Given all of this, a computer is made better by making it a disposable object. Backup your data, and backup your backups. Practice good password habits as much as possible so your accounts are isolated and somewhat disposable. Know your gameplan and what happens to your stuff if your computer or backups fall into a lava pit.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Knowing about vacation and disposable computing, I’m led to an odd and dissonant conclusion: an e-ink Kindle is the perfect computer. It does not do work, it does not social media. You can take it through airport security without any extra steps, which feels a little perverse and seems a bit surreal. It does not interrupt, it does not beep or blorp, it just barely displays text. As modern computers go, it’s basically useless.</p>
<p>But. You can read on it. And reading is so wonderful. And you can put stress aside. A Kindle gets wet? Not a big deal. Drop a Kindle? Not a big deal. Try to use it by the pool, out in nature, out in weather, out where the internet does not go? Not a big deal. Lose your Kindle? Buy another one, it costs a fraction of all your other computers.</p>
<p>The one scenario where you will find yourself absolutely screwed with a Kindle is when you have to enter text. Logging into Amazon or a wireless network for the first time? That’s a bad time.</p>
<p>In every other respect, the Kindle is a computer that does nothing to increase your stress level. That’s pretty remarkable today. Let’s make more calm computing devices, ok?</p>

			 <p>People in technology disproportionately like to comment on Apple’s products and business. Outside of technology, there are just as many folks who love to obsess over Disney’s theme parks. Based on my friend networks, I’d wager that for every person who obsesses over Apple’s keynotes, there’s a Disney enthusiast keeping up on special events and the best way to enjoy the theme parks.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The connection that strikes me is that both of these companies pay more attention to details than their competitors. Apple’s competitors throw software and hardware at the wall like spaghetti, hoping it will stick. Disney’s competitors rename their rides to match the blockbusters of summer. By comparison, Apple makes a big deal about the fit and finish of their hardware (let’s not talk about that camera though!) and has a coherent story about how all their products fit together into a useful landscape. Disney carefully arranges their parks to keep the guests in a cohesive movie world and pays attention to the little details that enhance or optimize the experience.</p>
<p>I could make some value judgement here about how attention to detail is more profitable, better design, better engineering, or whatever. I suspect all of those are true, but it’s not what excites me about Apple or Disney. When I read about changes to Disney’s theme parks or Apple’s keynotes, I’m excited that there are companies, quite large and successful ones, that are connecting lot of dots in an intriguing way. They’re extracting delight from large scale complexity. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Megaprojects<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are nifty and often enhance humanity, but they’re mostly out of touch or sight. It’s nice that some of us can experience and enjoy these commercial projects of vast scale and quality execution.</p>

			 <p>I think most teams, probably 90% of them, should start <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and stick with<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Rails conventions. Intelligently apply design principles, watch out for coupling that’s not worthwhile, carefully add dependencies when you must, sure. But don’t worry too much about erecting a wall between your app and Rails, building microservices, or whatever fashion dictates when you run <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rails new<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>That said, I don’t think strict adherence to Rails’ opinions is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only<!-- raw HTML omitted --> way to succeed when using Ruby to build for the web. You can adopt the principles of Rails’ opinions, e.g. use code over configuration to fight boilerplate or reduce the number of choices developers need to make by curating some libraries. You could document those principles and invest in new teammates by mentoring them up on your framework and tools.</p>
<p>Actually, you should do that anyway! But there are reasons you may not be able to do that: the team is too junior, time is tight, you need to explore new technical ground in other areas of the project. If that sounds like your team, you will benefit a lot from letting Rails do much of the tool-building, principle-seeking, and training for you.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lessons From A Lifetime Of Being A Programmer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ve taken this one seriously in the past, almost aways tinkering with languages, databases, frameworks, etc. I think it’s served me up to a point, expanding my mind and learning different ways to do to things.</p>
<p>The problem is I’ve reached the point of diminishing returns. I could go learn a stack-based language like Factor, or bend my brain around a oddly shaped database like Datomic. I’m not sure it would make me much better as a developer and leader of software teams.</p>
<p>Instead, the steamroller I think I need to keep ahead of is practice. Given a problem, what are three different solutions? What are their tradeoffs? Which approaches seem nice on paper, or in a blog post, but don’t work out a few hours down the road?</p>
<p>To wit:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well-tuned judgement is where I’m hoping to go next. Part of that is experience, knowing the forces and tradeoffs that apply to the possible solutions. Part of that is the ability to communicate it with teammates, sometimes face-to-face and sometimes asychronously. The really challenging part is letting your teammates run with the result of that judgement and collaboration.</p>
<p>A good developer makes good decisions for their own implementation; a great developer helps the whole team implement good decisions.</p>

			 <p>It’s Thursday. Sadly enough, this year, that means there’s football on. We’re far from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->peak<!-- raw HTML omitted --> football, but it’s getting closer. Prepare yourself, and tell your kids of the days when Sunday was a special day because no other day had real football. Now, on to more no-nonsense, jargon-free definitions of football jargon.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hail Mary<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the most desperate offensive play. If you’re doing poorly, the end is near, and you need a miracle, your Hail Mary effort is the low-odds, high reward manuever to save the day.</p>
<p>You start executing your plan with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->snap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>If someone inappropriately prevents someone else from doing their job, you could say they have committed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pass interference<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>If you’re not making progress forwards or backwards in your plan, and are instead moving laterally, you may have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gone sideways<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>If you want to commend a teammate for doing well, and you’re comfortable around them, you might give them an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ass slap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but be careful; everyone watching will notice it and wonder things.</p>
<p>Coaching in the NFL is now sufficiently complicated that coaches often have a list of plays that resembles a laminated <!-- raw HTML omitted -->take-out menu<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in-hand at all times on the sideline. This is addition to the radio headset that makes them look like they’re working the drive-through at your local burger joint.</p>
<p>A strategy that involves taking medium-to-high reward, low probability chances all the time is not too dissimilar from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->always passing the ball<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you were instead going for lower reward but higher probability tactics, you’d be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->always running the ball<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>If you run out of chances and don’t even succeed at a small incremental goal, you’ll have to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->punt<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The other team will get a chance and hopefully you’ll get to try again, but your tactical progress will probably be reset.</p>
<p>A strategy that emphasizes protecting against big losses over smaller losses is not unlike a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nickel defense<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>If you fail to protect the leader, you have given up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sack<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>It’s September and football season is upon us. Thus, I will soon annoy the snot out of people who say “sportsball” and generally ignore sports. Some will be able to mute me on Twitter and avoid most of the annoyance. Others, however, work with me on teams and will have to put up with the times when I slip and work a football metaphor in to the process of software development.</p>
<p>What follows is a glossary of things I may say that are football and/or sports related and a simple explanation of what they are. I’ve omitted what the term means in football so you don’t have to learn any sportsball if you don’t want to!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Move the goalposts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is when you change the rules so it’s easier for you to achieve your goal. It’s like how Captain Kirk solves the Kobayashi Maru test. (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ed. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Romerstein<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pointed out that moving the goal posts often means someone constantly changing the parameters of success such that it&rsquo;s impossible to <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->succeed. Beware!)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lead blocker<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is someone who precedes a person trying to get something done and removes impediments to their goal.</p>
<p>If you start doing something before the official start time, or you start doing it and then have to stop and start over almost immediately, it’s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->false start<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>If you fully succeed in the task at hand, you have scored a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->touchdown<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->penalty flag<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or just flag, is thrown when you break the rules.</p>
<p>If you force so many mistakes on your adversary that they run out of room to retreat, you have scored a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->safety<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>If you’re doing really well, and you don’t mind giving up a few small victories to get closer to winning the overall game, you are running a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->prevent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> defense.</p>
<p>You might attempt to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->run out the clock<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you’re winning and want to use a strategically conservative plan until the game is over and won.</p>
<p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blitz<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is an aggressive plan to overwhelm by speed and force. Just like the blitzkrieg, but with less actual war.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->draw<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is about the simplest tactic you can apply on offense. You rely on one person to get the job done and everyone else supports them.</p>
<p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->read option<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is one of the most complicated offensive tactics where you prepare multiple different strategies and the leader choses which one to execute at the last possible moment depending on what they see in the situation they face.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>More definitions coming soon! Leave a comment if there’s a sportsball term you’ve always wondered about and want a no-nonsense answer.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Microservices? I’m not entirely sure what they are. The term seems to exist on all parts of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hype cycle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> simultaneously. It’s on the ascent of excitement, the descent of disillusionment, and the plateau of productivity for different people, simultaneously. Some folks know exactly what it means, others know entirely nothing about what it means. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Weirdness ensues<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->People talk past each other<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>It’s a mess. Grumpy old man mode is in full force. (FWIW, I am the grumpy old man in this metaphor. I can not speak to the stature of Fowler or Feathers at this time.)</p>
<p>If I’m pessimistic, I nod along with Michael Feathers. He’s on to something when he observes the use of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->microservices as a blunt weapon against failures of encapsulation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Microservices become SOLID principles<!-- raw HTML omitted --> using units of deployment and even teams as a barrier between concerns. I feel that’s rather draconian.</p>
<p>If I’m optimistic, I cite Martin Fowler. To his credit, Fowler is doing the best work sifting through the noise and sensibly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->organizing what microservices might, in fact, be about<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They’re <!-- raw HTML omitted -->probably not distributed objects<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, if you do it right. But you should understand the details, lest you get swallowed by the novelty and forget to realize the benefits. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Make sure you’re tall enough for the ride<!-- raw HTML omitted --> your operations team is about to endure.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that radical approaches to working with Rails and microservices are tilting at the same windmill. You won’t fix the human tendency to build complicated structures with more software. Employing more buckets, or smaller buckets, in which to put your software doesn’t solve it either. You need a human factor to jump in and say “Hey, this is complicated! It might even be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->essentially<!-- raw HTML omitted --> complex. Let’s manage that complexity.” If you’re <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actively<!-- raw HTML omitted --> managing complexity, microservices or monoliths, Rails way or your own way, microservices and decoupling are a lot more of a detail than a foundational principle.</p>

<p>The owner of the Dallas Cowboys is his own worst enemy. His general manager, Jerry Jones, is able to make decisions good enough to prevent the team from sinking too far. He is not, however, able to make the decisions needed to return the team to legitimate contender status.</p>
<p>If you somehow made it this far without knowing much about football, let me clarify. Jerry Jones <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Jerry Jones.

<p>That said, it does sound like somewhat Faustian fun to hang out with Jones, as the ESPN reporter who wrote this piece did. On the one hand, it’s obvious that a billionaire is using his considerable resources to come off as a reasonable, alright dude. On the other hand, he stands on the side of not renaming the Washington football team, so you know that Jones is subtly awful in ways he can’t even begin to wrap his brain around.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There’s so much to designing that isn’t about choosing colors, fonts, producing icons, or drawing. Developers can, and should, get involved in how the applications works, how copy guides the user through workflows, when to prompt about invalid data and when to fix it automatically, and how to help users through interactions. That’s design!</p>
<p>To wit:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Developers often don’t even realize they’re designing when they’re building libraries and tools for other developers. Writing a good README so developers know why your project is awesome and how to use it? That’s design. Sweating the details of an OO or REST API? That’s design. Opting to remove a feature or solve two problems with one feature? That’s design!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The design was in us the whole time, and we didn’t even know it!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I leave you with this excellent wisdom:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s a fun thing I do that you should try: when you read articles about design, squint a little bit and pretend it’s about designing programs. You might find something you want to try the next time you sit down to work on some code.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been programming, as a full-time job, for more than ten years. I started doing Ruby, and Rails, nearly ten years ago. I’ve been at LivingSocial for a two and a half years now. If you add these numbers up you will find that I am, improbably, an old hand.</p>
<p>As I try to explain and contextualize our organization, technology, and culture inside LivingSocial, I often catch myself delicately dancing around saying “it’s always been this way”. It sucks to hear this. It’s easy for this to sound like a deflection. “Don’t worry yourself, just accept it and let me get back to whatever I was doing before you asked that foolish question.” Crawl back to your desk and grind away.</p>
<p>Beginner’s mind is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->crucial<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fleeting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so every person new to our communities and teams are invaluable. I want to extract as much information about how we’re confusing or mired in our legacy of stupidity. A beginner’s mind can help us improve our organizations, but only when it’s open and the experts aren’t marked as institutional damage to route around instead of engage with.</p>
<p>So I’m explaining organizational history and I find myself hand waving around “it’s always been this way, bask in despair!” At this point I (try to) profusely apologize and restart my explanation or answer. I need to get at that beginner’s mind before it becomes jaded in foregone conclusions.</p>
<p>But sometimes I don’t stop. I forget. I get wrapped up in accurately and concisely explaining <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it got this way and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it’s this way. I forget to actually answer the question or suggest how it might be made better.</p>
<p>Allow me apologize to everyone out there on the internet. Sometimes it might seem like I’m saying “it’s always been this way”, but really I got so wrapped up in giving a vigorous history lesson that I lost my train of thought. It might help to restate the question. I’m an old hand, after all, with a frail brain.</p>

			 <p>RailsConf 2014 having wrapped up a few weeks ago, now seems like a good time to try and unpack what I saw, heard, and talked to others about. Bear in mind I skipped RailsConf 2013 (but I&rsquo;ve been to all the others), so I may construe something as new that I simply missed last year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to break it down, as is my puzzle-solving wont, by technology and people.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Lots of people are excited about a few central topics.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->JavaScript<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They want to build ambitious apps, with Ember, Lineman, and other tools. Developers seem somewhat concerned that building apps this way is swimming upstream. Or that it&rsquo;s early days and things are changing quickly. Or they think it&rsquo;s awesome to work in a growing field. It&rsquo;s all of those things.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Service-oriented Architecture<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I went to talks about extracting services, designing services, implementing authentication/authorization across services, and how to write the client side of your various services. The talks felt like they were past the &ldquo;look at this novel thing!&rdquo; phase and into the &ldquo;well here&rsquo;s the nitty gritty&rdquo; phase. I didn&rsquo;t happen upon any sessions of the &ldquo;here&rsquo;s how this thing punched me in the face!&rdquo; sort, which is the kind of thing I, personally, want to learn about right now.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting outside of Rails<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Beyond SOA, some folks are going off the golden path and finding some success. I attended one good talk on adopting ideas from Domain Driven Design and hexagonal architecture. I found Ernie Miller&rsquo;s ideas about how he&rsquo;s worked with Rails' flaws interesting, even though I often didn&rsquo;t agree.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The conference started with David&rsquo;s keynote throwing barbs at the attitude some people display towards TDD (an ambiguous acryonym to start with). Many speakers opened with, in my opinion vapid, jokes about this. Other people seemed to take personal offense that TDD might not be everything. These reactions were, I found, not particularly interesting. The more interesting ones were those who found it as a challenge to consider how they build applications, either through taste and intuition or through reasoning and engineering.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always, at least in conversations I find myself in, some question of where Rails is now. Relative to other technologies, is it a leader, a follower, a player, a has-been? Every year, it&rsquo;s more of a safe assumption that Rails is a given, that it&rsquo;s not going to up and disappear. Still, there&rsquo;s a desire to keep it fresh, avoid stagnation, and above all avoid becoming the demons (J2EE, .NET, PHP, etc.) that people used before Rails. A lot of this discussion seems to be happening around the size and frameworkness of Rails. There has always been pockets of interest around things that are smaller than Rails (like Sinatra, ROM, etc.) More interesting, there is some defense of largeness now, especially in the context of Ember. This is the most interesting, and at times tedious, debate, for me personally.</p>
<p>The attendance of RailsConf continues to grow more diverse. The inclusiveness efforts of the organizers and community at large seem to be bearing fruit. I saw more ladies and more minorities than I have at any conference of this size. Further, the crowd felt less startup-centric than years past. Plenty of folks from startups, sure, but also people at different kinds of businesses: small, big, hardware, software, commerce, marketing, non-profit, etc. What&rsquo;s more, it was easier than ever to find myself in a conversation with people not entirely like myself. That&rsquo;s a quite good thing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Lots of people are concerned about Rails, its community, and such. There&rsquo;s a vibe, not unlike 2008 or 2009 when some were seeking other ways to build Ruby web apps, that perhaps the framework, the community, and the leaders thereof don&rsquo;t have all the answers. That may sound damning, but it&rsquo;s a pretty healthy attitude. The problems developers face and the way we build our programs are, as ever, changing as we&rsquo;re building them. The tension is out there, but having been through most of a technology hype cycle with Rails, I&rsquo;m not worried that the community won&rsquo;t find the resolution of that tension.</p>

			 <p>Conjecture: thinking about releasing software versions to users/partners/the public in dotted version numbers, e.g. &ldquo;1.0, 2.1, 5.3&rdquo; is a symptom of misshaped thinking. This line of thinking seems framed by the notion that only a dozen major versions will ever be released. Certainly, some software works that way: shrink-wrap software, video game consoles, etc.. Most notably, dotted release versions are very useful for software used to build software.</p>
<p>However, its increasingly true that software doesn&rsquo;t really work until it reaches &ldquo;version&rdquo; two-hundred something. But maybe that&rsquo;s another problematic frame of thinking&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never liked English-like APIs either. Consider that AppleScript is, bizarrely, completely unusable by people who know how to program in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any <!-- raw HTML omitted -->other programming language.</p>
<p>If you think unpack &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just English&rdquo; a bit, it&rsquo;s easy to see why you should run away screaming from anything describing itself as being English-like in a good way.

			 <p>Some folks from GitHub sprung the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Atom text editor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the internet yesterday. Releasing a product into a market defined by saturation, settling for brokenness, and zero-cost alternatives is a bold move. I applaud them for jumping into it.

<p>If you’re wondering whether Atom is the right thing for you, it might help you to know I went through a sort of quest several years ago to decide what was vital to me when editing text:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Writing these, thinking deeply about the kinds of problems I did and did not want to solve with my text editor and what that meant for my workflow, was exciting. I learned a lot about finding my own principles.</p>
<p>I ended up, to my great surprise, choosing Vim. Most importantly, that decision stuck. I haven’t gazed upon the possibly greener grasses of other text editors since I committed to my principles and workflow. Whether it turns out Atom is your thing or not, thinking about the principles of how you want to work with computer programs is a thing you might benefit from.</p>

			 <p>A great thing about writing is that it focuses and sharpens one’s thoughts. The great thing about writing in public is that your thoughts, when passed through the brains of others, sometimes yield even better thoughts. The greatest thing about writing is when you hit publish feeling confident about your position and end up with your opinion flipped once the conversation is over.</p>
<p>So it went with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A tale of two Rails view<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that a few hours after I’d published it, my mind was changed.</p>
<p>On the one hand, you can take a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->permissive stance on views<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and ivars. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave Copeland nicely laid this idea out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->responsible<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about minimizing sharing ivars between actions and views, you have a chance. In this case, that means sharing one or two ivars, no more. Placing a little trust in your fellow developers lets you put off the day when you need to isolate state behind helper methods or other restrictive abstractions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can take a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->contractual stance on views<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and require all data passing between actions and view to do so through a specific object. Tony Pitale’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SimplestView<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does just this. It unifies views and partials into one name, “templates”, and then provides backing objects (somewhat confusingly called views). Actions create the backing objects and templates consume them. Nothing can leak through, no hunting down the origin of an ivar needed in this template but not yet defined in that one.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the middle are ideas about building a bridge between the action and the view. One could use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->responds_with<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as said bridge, but, for me, that felt like it played better with APIs than traditional views<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[1]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. A possible middle ground is to use something like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->decent_exposure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interesting spin on it by Nathan Ladd<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I like that Nathan’s approach is basically sugar over the pattern of encapsulating action state behind controller helper methods which are shared between views. I’ve been using the helper method approach so far, but it’s a little awkward to test and confusing for those used to sharing ivars.</p>
<p>If you’re sick of the baby <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the bath water, you might find a more extreme approach interesting. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Focused Controller<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->poniard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do away with Rails conventions entirely. You still write controllers, but how you load data and model actions is entirely different. Personally, these are interesting sources of ideas. I’m not sure I’d jump on them for a production application.</p>
<p>Of all these approaches, I’m most intrigued by SimplestView. It seems like the Minimum Viable Departure from Rails conventions that could possibly solve the problem of sharing state and defining a contract on that state. That said, I’m likely to try Dave Copeland’s approach first. I like that it’s about talking with teammates, reviewing each other’s work, and making smart decisions. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’m finding that no amount of framework is as good at helping people write good code as review, feedback, and iteration.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Why do I prefer to avoid referencing instance variables in view?</p>
<p>I needed to clarify this personal principle to a teammate recently. It was one of those things I&rsquo;ve internalized so strongly that it was initially difficult for me to do so; one of those things that have become so true to me that teaching someone else about it requires getting past the &ldquo;well, obviously it&rsquo;s the best, that&rsquo;s why&rdquo; phase of mental tantrum.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An entirely made-up, possibly oversimplified Rails view fragment:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is a by-the-book Rails view. Set an ivar in an action, use it in views (and helpers), you&rsquo;re done, get back to thinking about building product.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to iterate with this. It&rsquo;s easy to see data &ldquo;passed&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> into the view by scanning for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sigil; your editor probably does this already. It&rsquo;s easy to move markup around in templates with a simple cut-paste.</p>
<p>If you stick with ivars long enough, you&rsquo;re going to end up with two kinds of misadventures.</p>
<p>Most commonly, you&rsquo;ll wonder why <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@user<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is nil for some view or edge case. Maybe you forgot a filter or didn&rsquo;t set it in an action? Backend developers are sometimes equipped with the curiosity and knowledge to fix this themselves. For front-end developers or those new to the system, this kind of error is basically &ldquo;womp-womp sad music go interrupt someone who can help you&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This leads to the second misadventure: where did this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@user<!-- raw HTML omitted --> thing come from<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->? Maybe it was set in a helper, or a filter, or an action? Well now you&rsquo;ve painted yourself into a weak spot of a language like Ruby. Your tools probably can&rsquo;t point you directly at the line of code where a variable came into being. You can do some clever grep&rsquo;ing around<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, probably. At best, you know the system well enough to get to the right file and find it, or there&rsquo;s some convention you can use to intuit where it might be set.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Of course this way is better, right?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well, not initially. Already you have to pick a good name for a method because you&rsquo;re probably going to use it all over the place. Then you have to find a good place to put that method: on a helper method? on a helper object? on a model?, i.e. now you&rsquo;re making decisions, which is a thing Rails tries to shield you from wherever possible. Personally, I find naming things quite entertaining and hardly one of the hardest problems in computer science<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>A marginal benefit comes from reducing the entry points that the name <!-- raw HTML omitted -->current_user<!-- raw HTML omitted --> came to be a thing in this view: it&rsquo;s a method name, a local variable, or a view-local variable passed into the template<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Thus the search space for &ldquo;where did this thing come from&rdquo; is way smaller for typical Rails templates and manageably smaller for unreasonable Rails templates.</p>
<p>This way pays off once the application gets past the point where new code tidily fits into models, views, controllers, or helpers. At that point, you need objects, messages, and experience at building with objects and messages (successes, stalemates, and abject failures)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->6<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you&rsquo;re competent at messages (i.e. method calls) in Ruby, you can at this point experience a &ldquo;this is Unix, I know this!&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->7<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> moment and work with this method call like you would any other method/function invocation in a computer program.</p>
<p>Making this investment into a method call yields another long-term benefit: simplicity in experimentation and testing<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->8<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I can poke at helper methods and helper objects in a Rails console without breaking a sweat. If that feedback loop doesn&rsquo;t get the job done, I can write tests against helpers and (some) controller methods to iterate on figuring out why something doesn&rsquo;t work the way I think it should.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that blogging about programming is so popular. Programming involves a lot of tradeoffs. Tradeoffs make for wordy articles that don&rsquo;t leave you thinking &ldquo;yeah, those other guys are SOOOO WRONG&rdquo; or &ldquo;YEAHHHH I&rsquo;m so right&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;ve written this properly, hopefully you felt both of those feelings. Maybe you reminisced about a day when you thought view ivars were great and then regretted it. Perhaps it&rsquo;s easier to see why you&rsquo;d start an app or feature off using ivars and then refactor them to method calls later.</p>
<p>With instance variables in views, as with many other grey areas of Rails, the most useful long view is this: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you&rsquo;re always right, and you&rsquo;re always wrong, it just depends on which &ldquo;you&rdquo; (past you, present you, legacy project you, greenfield project you) is being observed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>A venture-funded startup is sort of like a space program. Space programs don&rsquo;t build airplanes that fly in flat, predictable, safe trajectories. They shouldn&rsquo;t be concerned with doing something pedestrian. Space programs should be concerned with doing something very unusual, perhaps unnatural.</p>
<p>Like a space program, a funded startup is equal parts propaganda and collection of great minds. During the first few rounds of financing, a startup is completely unlike an actual business. It&rsquo;s all growth: technical growth, metrics growth, mindshare growth, operational growth, staff growth. It&rsquo;s about gathering smart, driven people and making something new without the confines of traditional market forces. It&rsquo;s about showing that new thing off to the world, making everyone think that they either really need to have it or that they&rsquo;re behind in the race to make something like it.</p>
<p>Startups, like space programs, take a bunch of volatile materials and apply them to make an impossible climb. Quite often, those materials explode on the pad or in the first couple minutes of flight. Sometimes all the systems work together, months of effort by teams coordinated by a few masterminds, and the startup or spaceship gets off the ground.</p>
<p>Even if the startup or spaceship survives it&rsquo;s first minutes, most of it is discarded as it ascends. A Saturn V weighed millions of pounds on the launch pad; what returns to Earth weight thousands of pounds in the end. Systems are built, used, and discarded many times over. Depending on a startup&rsquo;s exit, what remains is only one of many ideas or systems built over time, sometimes an idea expressed in the heads of a few key people.</p>
<p>Space programs are great. Startups are great. Keep in mind that they are wholly unlike more commonplace human endeavors and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>

			 <p>Adding new functionality to software is really exciting. I love poking around the edges of a system, figuring out what&rsquo;s going on, and looking for that &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; place where the first change should happen. But sometimes, it&rsquo;s hard to know if I&rsquo;m making the right change. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How Should This Work?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Even if you code test first, you can make a mess of a system. What you end up with is a system that moves from local maximum to local maximum while the time of the test suite grows unbounded. There are worse things that could happen, but no one&rsquo;s going to jot this one down as a &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; either.</p>
<p>The counterforce to this temptation is the red-green-refactor cycle. Look at how the system works and figure out how the next bit of work might change how the system works. Refactor to simplify the act of making a change, or make the change and refactor afterwards to a better design.</p>
<p>Software can grow by accretion, but it stays malleable when the team culture is one that balances continuous growth with continuous cultivation of good design.</p>

			 <p>Lately, I find myself stopping to make sure I haven&rsquo;t previously written the thing I&rsquo;m currently writing. For starters, I have a horrible method for moving things out of my &ldquo;I should finish this idea&rdquo; folder into the &ldquo;I wrote about this idea!&rdquo; folder. It doesn&rsquo;t help that I often draft articles in my head while I run, shower, or do chores and then forget that I had the thought. It&rsquo;s kind of a mess in here.</p>
<p>Assuming that I slip up and write the idea down twice, hopefully it&rsquo;s in a way that doesn&rsquo;t look like I&rsquo;m plagiarizing myself. Is it weird to write about the same thing multiple times, if it&rsquo;s nearly the same idea?</p>
<p>I hate repeating myself, telling the same stories over and over.  &ldquo;Have I told you this one before?&rdquo; is a frequent prologue to great stories. But is it necessary? Hearing a mediocre story twice is slightly painful, but hearing a great story twice is no chore at all.</p>
<p>If I keep writing an idea, coming back to it, maybe there&rsquo;s something important there? Perhaps it&rsquo;s still bouncing around in my brain for a reason. I haven&rsquo;t fully wrapped my head around it, or articulated the idea in a way I find satisfying and essential.</p>
<p>This is a personal website; the line between &ldquo;just play the hits&rdquo; and &ldquo;stop trying to make fetch happen&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have to be so strong here as it would on, say, the New York Times. So, stop me if I write about an idea so much I run it into the ground. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m trying to get it out of my head in the right way.</p>

			 <p>First, read all of this excellent distillation of distributed systems by Jay Kreps,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data&rsquo;s unifying abstraction<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Now, consider this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a moment, when you&rsquo;re building services and web APIs, when you think you&rsquo;ve pretty much got it under control. You&rsquo;ve got an endpoint for every query, a resource for every workflow. All the use-cases seem to be under control. And then, the question appears:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I get access to all the updates to all the data? You know, for [REASONS].&rdquo;</p>
<p>For APIs exposed to external developers over the web, this is where you&rsquo;d reach for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->web hooks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PubSubHubbub<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s not the best solution, but it works. If you&rsquo;re building an internal system, you could  use the same approaches, or&hellip;you could build a log.</p>
<p>No not that kind of log. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->An event log, like LinkedIn did with Kafka for their internal systems<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Every time your data model changes, every create, update, or delete, you drop an event with all the metadata related to the change. The event goes into some kind of single-producer, multiple consumer queue. Then all the clients that want to know about all the changes to all the things can read events off the queue and do whatever it is they need to for those important REASONS.</p>
<p>If you find this intriguing, this is a lot like replication in database systems. Definitely read LinkedIn&rsquo;s article on this, and definitely read up on how your database of choice handles replication. And if you&rsquo;ve built this before and have a good answer to initially populating &ldquo;replicas&rdquo; of a database, let me know; I haven&rsquo;t come up with anything better than &ldquo;just rsync it&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>So, Adam from a few years ago, you think you can build a distributed system?</p>
<p>Designing a concurrent system, one that runs across multiple processors using shared memory threads, is difficult because someone can move your cheese. One moment you&rsquo;ve got food on your plate, and the next moment it&rsquo;s on someone else&rsquo;s plate.</p>
<p>Designing distributed systems, one that runs across multiple computers over networks that occasionally do weird things, is difficult because you can&rsquo;t assume that the message will get through. One moment you&rsquo;re telling your friend about an awesome new album and the next moment they don&rsquo;t even know who you are anymore.</p>
<p>In both scenarios, you can&rsquo;t assume the simplest case. You have to discard Occam&rsquo;s razor; it&rsquo;s entirely possible a perfectly devious alien is tinkering with your system, swallowing messages or preventing threads from running. For every operation in your system, you have to ask yourself what could go wrong and how will my system deal with that?</p>
<p>The first jarring thing about these sorts of problems is that you&rsquo;re probably not using a framework. There are libraries to help you with logging, instrumentation, storage, coordination, and low-level primitives. There aren&rsquo;t a lot of well-curated collections of opinions expressed as code. There&rsquo;s no Rails, no Play, no Django, no Cocoa. There&rsquo;s hardly even a Sinatra, a Celery, a JDBC.</p>
<p>That means you&rsquo;re going to be designing, for real. Drawing on whiteboard, building prototypes and proofs of concepts. Getting feedback from as many smart people as you can corner. Questioning your assumptions, reading everything you can find on the topic. Looking for tradeoffs that decrease risk and simplify your problem domain.</p>
<p>Accept that you&rsquo;re unlikely to ever get it entirely right. Those who are really good at it are more like Scotty than Spock. They&rsquo;re surrounded by levers and measurements, tweaking and rebuilding the system as they go. It&rsquo;s a fun puzzle!</p>

			 <p>In Cocoa, you can poke inside object graphs (and more!) using dotted strings:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hey, did you notice that Objective-C sprouted some really handy literals for arrays and dictionaries lately? One could reasonably extrapolate that Apple has an interest in not breaking people’s fingers when they build for iOS and OS X.</p>
<p>There are libraries, e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hashie<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that make uniform access into object graphs, like you might get from an API response, as close to idiomatic Ruby as you probably want. Key paths, as implemented in Cocoa’s Key-Value Coding APIs, takes a different approach, using strings to define paths to traverse an object graph. I don’t really like “string programming”, but it’s an interesting approach, so let’s see where it takes us. Let’s add something like “key paths” to Ruby!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Enumerable is an awesome thing about Ruby. Let’s build key path traversal on top of that. The goal is something close to the Objective-C snippet above:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Turns out this isn’t hard to implement, even with a little error handling thrown in:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>OK, first off, did you realize that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SimpleDelegator<!-- raw HTML omitted --> makes it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ridiculously<!-- raw HTML omitted --> easy to wrap objects with extra behavior? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It sure does!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Second, you could easily write this with a while loop or even a simple <!-- raw HTML omitted -->each<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but why have local variables hanging around when you could use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->inject<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instead?!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[1]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Third, this has more conditionals than I’d like, but it fits within 80 columns<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[2]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so I’ll take it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ve got this code, based on a whim. I’m not even sure it’s a good idea. Maybe it is!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Maybe it sucks?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I can’t really tell you, definitively, if you should try this or not. I’ve barely even used KVC in Cocoa! It’s a nifty idea, though, and it’s pretty rad that you can implement something like it in Ruby so trivially.</p>
<p>Now you know!</p>

<p>The big idea from that article, burning a hole in my head, is that we should step away from our desks when we&rsquo;re not working (for me, telling computers to do things). Thinking can happen on a walk, standing outside, or in the shower. Socializing can happen from the couch or mobile device. Procrastinating by reading, surfing, social networking, etc. can happen anywhere.</p>
<p>Once I freed my mind from the idea that I&rsquo;m only working the moments my butt is in a chair at a desk in front of a computer, my work improved and my life got better. Quit your desk and find out for yourself.</p>

			 <p>Making a cup of coffee sometimes helps me prepare for the process of solving puzzles with computers. Something about choosing AeroPress, French press, Chemex, or Clever; heating the water to 212F or 200F; medium-fine, medium, or coarse grinding of the beans. The weighing and grinding of the beans, boiling the water, rinsing the filter, pouring the water, waiting, pouring more water, agitating, pressing the coffee, discarding the filter and grinds. Now I&rsquo;m left with a cup that I made for myself. A minor victory for the day.</p>
<p>All sorts of things require warm-ups. Stretching, air-squatting, or a quick jog lets my body know it&rsquo;s almost time to exert itself. Word association or playing little games tells my brain it&rsquo;s time to improvise.</p>
<p>Updating some documentation. A tiny, superficial refactoring or layout change to some code. Drawing a picture in my notebook. Making some coffee. That&rsquo;s how I know it&rsquo;s time to solve puzzles.</p>

			 <p>We can often, but not always, choose to ignore those on the internet, on TV, and in our lives with different ideas, philosophies, or opinions about the world. Whether intentional or accidental, this is ignorance.</p>
<p>Ignorance is handy because it can keep us sane. We can&rsquo;t know all the things or have all the experiences. We all value things based on our own experiences and learnings. We cross-reference that with our ego and emotions and come up with our &ldquo;truths&rdquo;. Conflicting &ldquo;truths&rdquo; can hurt, and so we only let some kinds of them in and trim our lives to exclude the others. This is helpful for reducing stress and making for more happy days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not great though, because it isolates us from seeing more of the world and understanding it more clearly. Many media fights/beefs/arguments are rooted in conflicting &ldquo;truths&rdquo; and collisions of ignorance. You ignore the value of a supportive government, I ignore the value of maximum personal liberty, and boom! we&rsquo;re arguing. We&rsquo;re not getting things done.</p>
<p>Personally, that arguing is stressful. I&rsquo;d rather not get worked up about politics, governance, and technical minutiae if at all possible. Therefore, I selectively engage in ignorance. I try to double check my assumptions and ignorance occasionally; I find ignorance is a useful <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tactic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not a long-term <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strategy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>If you could imagine a world where empathy ruled and everyone possessed a superpower for compromise, you might see a world where ignorance isn&rsquo;t so much of a problem and amazing things can get done. Oh, what a fantastic, science-fiction world!</p>
<p>Ignorance is bliss <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that which prevents us from achieving really big things. Use your ignorance carefully and with consideration.</p>

			 <p>I like to listen to podcasts and screencasts at two or three times the recorded speed. The application I use (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instacast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) does this with pitch correction, a feature that&rsquo;s probably built into iOS at this juncture. In short, I can listen to a thirty minute podcast in ten to fifteen minutes and they only sound funny when music plays. I do mean funny; listen to Radiohead&rsquo;s &ldquo;Creep&rdquo; at 3x speed and it comes out downright chipper.</p>
<p>Our brains can process speech at these accelerated rates just fine. In fact, when I listen to some of my favorite podcasters in &ldquo;real&rdquo; time, they sound like they&rsquo;re thinking really hard and speaking slowly, or that they&rsquo;re flat-out drunk. The interesting bit is when an accelerated speaker has an accent or when there is radio interference with the FM transmitter I use in the car. At this point, all bets are off and I have to slow the podcast down or listen when the signal is better.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that, empirically, human speech has built-in redundancy. We tend to speak at a rate that, if you miss some sounds, you can probably still make out the words. Further, the space in-between words is probably filled with our own thoughts anyway; we only listen part of the time we&rsquo;re listening.</p>
<p>Nifty things, our brains are.</p>

			 <p>Carried complexity is the bane of your application. When you add something to software, you incur the cost of doing the work plus the risk that the change will break something in already deployed versions of the software.

<p>Software developers are most adept at identifying and resisting complexity when it comes from the product or business guys. Adding this feature will take a few days, fixing this bug will take a few hours, generating that report will take a week. This change might sound good for getting that new customer, but the way it interacts with the other features will confuse lots of people in the long run.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably thought or said all of these things in the past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to realize we put it upon ourselves too. Are there two ways of solving the same problem in your project, team, or organization? Are you migrating from one framework/queue/architecture to another? Those are complexities that you are carrying around in your head. They aren&rsquo;t inherently bad, but they are costly, and it is important to weigh the pros and cons before you commit to them. When you choose to incur complexity, make sure it&rsquo;s buying you something and not just shuffling the bits around a little bit.</p>

But they&rsquo;re still solving problems, moving the needle. They&rsquo;re just, possibly, less obsessed with technology tribalism and fashion. Some days, that seems like a pretty useful space to find oneself in.</p>

			 <p>When software becomes successful, software often becomes large. More features, more support systems, more infrastructure, more people, etc. Therefore, software &ldquo;in the large&rdquo; seems like a good problem to solve: how can you work at the same pace with one person, one application, and one server when you reach a hundred people, ten applications and a thousand servers?</p>
<p>Right now, I think the only tool we have for reducing the overhead of large systems and organizations is language. Frameworks and libraries can help make larger applications plausible, but they don&rsquo;t resist the forces that make a large application hard to work with. Tooling and process, like source control or CI, only help us keep large software going; they don&rsquo;t slow us down on the path to producing huge software.</p>
<p>Better programming languages make it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->possible<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to produce software that does more things in a more concise statement. To some extent better &ldquo;API language&rdquo; makes that possible too, but it relies on the power of the host language.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so easily tempted and fascinated by The New Shiny, it&rsquo;s refreshing to read about a shop getting by with The Old Trusted instead.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am a giant music nerd. I listen to a ton of music, I think about music a lot, and I often seek out new music via Twitter and Rdio (🪦RIP). Besides a dislike for showtunes and reggae, I’m a pretty broad listener.</p>
<p>Yet, it is exceedingly rare that I seek out live music. When I do, I’m that concert goer who is only buying tickets for long-established acts. In the past several years, I’ve seen Paul McCartney, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Lucinda Williams, Steely Dan, Ben Folds, and Ryan Adams. The youngest of these started their career twenty years ago.</p>
<p>What’s up with that? Well, I (mostly) don’t like live music. I’ve got reasons.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The reasons that performances at live music venues don&rsquo;t start on time come down to selfishness. The performers didn&rsquo;t arrive on time, the stage wasn&rsquo;t set up in time. Worse, these have a knock-on effect. Once a performance is behind, it only gets <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more<!-- raw HTML omitted --> behind. There&rsquo;s no shortening the break between bands or reducing the time between doors opening and the first band playing.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the most inane reason live music is not on time: selling beer. &ldquo;Doors open at 8 PM&rdquo; almost universally means that you can walk in at 8 PM, but you can count on not seeing any live music until 9 PM. The opening act for the opening act is the selling of booze. I&rsquo;ve got better ways to spend my time than standing around for an hour staking out a spot just so the venue can sell beer.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thank you, venues with seats, and thank you, crowds that don&rsquo;t feel the need to show their enthusiasm by standing upright. You make live music a much more civil, enjoyable experience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I salute events that eschew the opening act and cut straight to the main performer. Give the people what they want.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Beyond the personal discomfort, there&rsquo;s nothing about loudness that makes music better. If everything is loud, nothing is loud. Sustained loudness is boring.</p>
<p>Short bouts of loudness; that&rsquo;s interesting. The juxtaposition of the opening arpeggios of &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t It Be Nice&rdquo; with the wall-of-sound that follows is really nice. The way &ldquo;Thunder Road&rdquo; or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bolero<!-- raw HTML omitted --> grow into something loud and great is what makes them interesting. The amazing loudness of the opening of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also Sprach Zarahustra<!-- raw HTML omitted --> contrasted with the nearly non-existent quietness of the second movement is genius.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t turn it up because you can. Turn it up because you mean it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is problematic for two reasons. First off, drums are really loud in the hands of an enthusiastic player. Often quite a bit louder than your typical amplifier. Thus, it&rsquo;s guaranteed you&rsquo;re going to hear a lot more drums than guitars, horns, strings, or vocals at a live music event. I take that back; I guarantee you that you will not be able to hear strings at any music club you ever go to, but I&rsquo;ll come back to that.</p>
<p>The more problematic aspect of a drum kit is you&rsquo;re going to hear <!-- raw HTML omitted -->raw drums<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when you go to a live music event. Very little microphone tricks or equalizer cleverness; the drums may not even be isolated. That means the snare is going to sound like a can of beans getting hit with a stick. The toms will sound like someone banging on an empty box. The cymbals are going to sound like a mad person beating on pots and pans.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you&rsquo;re not going to enjoy them drums.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Assuming that clubs don&rsquo;t exist merely to move booze (not a big leap in reasoning, I know), I don&rsquo;t understand how this is the situation. If you want to be a part of a music scene, a good sound system and someone who can operate it seems like par for the course.</p>
<p>I am happy to note that, if you&rsquo;re lame like me and only go to see performers who have been around the block dozens of times, you&rsquo;re going to have a much better listening experience. Less prominent musicians are starting to tour with just one accompanying performer and that person is not playing a drum kit. The A-list performers have really good drummers (Paul McCartney&rsquo;s drummer is a blast to watch) and the sound engineers on the tour are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->excellent<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This makes for a far more enjoyable, balanced sound.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I do enjoy watching very talented performers do their thing. Someone who mixes music with a good stage show or interesting banter between songs is fun to watch. The Rolling Stones are interesting to watch because Mick Jagger is such a good showman, Charlie Watts seems so apathetic, and Keith Richards is, well, Keef. I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed seeing Hayes Carll and Lyle Lovett because the stories they tell are great and their banter between songs is amusing.</p>
<p>Genres I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->don&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> know how to make are also fascinating. Hip-hop is not a thing I really know how to make, so that&rsquo;s fun. Jazz and classical can be fun because I know how they work but didn&rsquo;t reach the level where I could <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> make it. My new rule is, whenever <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rite of Spring<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is performed, I need to be there; it&rsquo;s relatively short (about forty minutes), really awesome, and I&rsquo;m certain I would not be able to perform it with an orchestra without ruining it for everyone else.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m doing it wrong. Perhaps my heuristics for trying to time a concert so I arrive as the opening act is finishing require tweaking. I should definitely remember to bring earplugs more often. It&rsquo;s entirely possible I&rsquo;m just a grumpy guy.</p>
<p>But: I&rsquo;m not the guy who tells you about the hippest new musical thing. I&rsquo;m probably not the guy who&rsquo;s going to catch your favorite band. I&rsquo;m the guy who goes to see Paul McCartney out of reverence and because my wife and I both like him. I&rsquo;m the guy who listens to an album as a long-form idea. I&rsquo;m the guy who wants to understand the history and creation of a thing. That&rsquo;s just the nerd I am: I understand music over time, not over the course of an evening.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ed. this originally ran in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Internet Todo List for Enthusiastic Readers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You should check that out. It was pointed out that I&rsquo;m a bit of an old man. In spirit, this is absolutely true. Also worth noting: I&rsquo;m going to see Paul McCartney again this week, so I must not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->entirely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hate live music. Human inconsistencies, eh?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>You don’t have to deploy every bit of code you write. In fact, it’s pretty healthy if you throw away some of the code you write before you even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->think<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about committing it.</p>
<p>Case in point: I sat down to refactor some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sifter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> code this weekend. I wanted to experiment with an idea about how Rails apps should be organized. I moved some code around, stepped back, and decided the idea behind my refactoring wasn’t sufficiently well cooked and stashed it instead of committing it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think that one can follow SOLID principles without radically decoupling your app from Rails and especially ActiveRecord. Instead, you let AR objects do what they’re good at: representing data. You push behavior, as much as possible, out into objects. What you should end up with is a handful of models that encapsulate the tables in your database and a bunch of classes that encapsulate the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->logic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and behavior of your application; whether these classes live in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->app/models<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or somewhere else is a matter of personal taste.</p>
<p>My goal is to extract an object that encapsulates user authentication behavior; a class that is mostly concerned with conditions and telling other objects to do things. I extracted a class focused on “remember me” session behavior. It looked something like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then, for compatibility, I added this to the model:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The principles I’m following are thus:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Further, using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->delegate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> means the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->User<!-- raw HTML omitted --> model’s API surface area isn’t actually reduced. Granted, this is a stopgap measure. I should really hunt down all invocations of the delegated method and convert them to use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->UserAuthentication<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instead.</p>
<p>At this point, it feels like my refactoring isn’t making forward progress. I’ve rearranged things a bit, but I don’t think I’ve made the code that much better.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I alluded earlier, I decided to stash this refactoring for later contemplation. Maybe next time I should start from the callers of the APIs I want to refactor and drive the changes from there. Perhaps my conjecture about decoupling ActiveRecord data from application behavior needs tuning.</p>
<p>I beat the “ship lots of stuff!” drum a lot, but I’m happy with this result. Learning to strike the balance between shipping the first thing you type out and the thing your future self won’t hate is an undervalued skill. It takes practice, and that’s just what I did here. Plus, I parleyed it into a blog post. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everyone wins<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a lot to say about programmer-focused software documentation. It&rsquo;s more crucial than many developers think, so it is often neglected. Even when its not neglected, it&rsquo;s often an after-thought. I&rsquo;ve noticed there are three kinds of documentation I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>
<p>When I first come across some software, I want <!-- raw HTML omitted -->short and focused examples<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of how I can use it for my own purposes. I&rsquo;m not looking for a lot of theory or exposition; show me the benefit. If I can&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quickly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> see how the software works and makes my life easier, I&rsquo;m very likely to discard it. In other words, I want shorter, &ldquo;tweet-sized&rdquo; documentation that sells me on the sizzle right away.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If I come back to some software, I often want to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->learn the whole thing in one sitting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I want a longer document that I can read through in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serial<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fashion to learn most or all of the concepts and details about using the code. It should cover the domain ideas of the software, the individual APIs, and how it all works together to make something. To continue the metaphor, I want a well-written, &ldquo;Instapaper-length&rdquo; document worthy of reading in a comfy chair.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After I start using something, I will often want to return to it to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->remember<!-- raw HTML omitted --> how to do specific things or to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->figure out<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if a task is possible at all. This is when I lean most on traditional API documentation. One to three paragraphs, easily searched are the ideal here. Kind of like the &ldquo;Tumblr-post&rdquo; of documentation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve yet to find all three of these qualities in the documentation for a single piece of software. Finding that software has done a really good job at one of them is delight enough. I can&rsquo;t imagine how excited the world, at large, would be if something were to have all three. There would be a lot of rejoicing.</p>

			 <p>In the days of industrial labor, many factories ran three shifts per day. Three eight-hour shifts per day keeps a factory fully utilized and some business major&rsquo;s spreadsheets happy. Luckily, for many of us, knowledge/thinking oriented businesses don&rsquo;t usually follow this paradigm. We&rsquo;re not (often) pressured to pick up a double shift, possibly freeing time to do useful things that we don&rsquo;t get paid for.</p>
<p>For the ambitious (possible euphemism), this opens up an interesting opportunity: allocating the second shift to one&rsquo;s own projects. Writing that great book you&rsquo;ve got inside you, penciling a comic, running your Etsy business on the side, or bootstrapping that web app you&rsquo;re dreaming about all make a great fit for a second shift. Find time before or after your day job, and then aim for the sky.</p>
<p>I found it easy to take this logic to the next level and think, well if two shifts works and I can make progress on <em>two</em> things, three shifts might work and then I can do <em>three</em> things! Wake up early, do something awesome. Work the nine to five, do awesome things. Take a couple hours in the evening, do even more awesome things. Seems good, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the third shift is a bandaid over too many projects and lead me to do lower quality work across the board.</p>
<p>I need more physical rest and mental space than working on three things affords. Turning down an extra hour of sleep or the bleeping of an alarm clock is a hard bargain. One side project, as it turns out, is plenty.</p>
<p>That said, the third shift <em>is</em> useful as a &ldquo;turbo button&rdquo; that I only press when I really mean it and used only for short-term projects that are important to whatever awesome thing I&rsquo;m trying to do. A couple weeks waking up early to bang out a presentation  or longer-form article are good. Sustaining that for a series of projects doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<p>In short: ambition is great, but striking a balance with mental and physical rest is better.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Saturday Night Live<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a changing thing. It&rsquo;s not new like it was in the seventies, it&rsquo;s not a powerhouse like it was in the nineties, it may not be the training camp for NBC sitcoms anymore. Despite that, its still a big dog in the worlds of comedy and pop culture. Every time I hear or read &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->SNL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was better when…&rdquo;, I cringe a little. As far as I can tell, this isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s got their favorite cast. Ferrell/Shannon/Sanz/Oteri, Fey/Poehler/Rudolph, Hartman/Carvey/Myers. It seems largely to depend on whenever you started watching SNL or when you were a teenager or in college. So when someone says &ldquo;SNL isn&rsquo;t relevant any more&rdquo;, I mentally substitute &ldquo;I liked SNL better with the cast I watched first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the years of watching and reading about SNL, I&rsquo;ve come to understand that the show is very much about the people on camera, but Lorne Michaels <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the show. The only time the show has been in consistent decline was when Michaels wasn&rsquo;t around in the early eighties. For the past thirty years, claiming SNL was on the down seems to be more of a sport than a rational argument.</p>
<p>Since Michaels' return, the show is subject to fractal cycles. Each night, some skits kill and some skits bomb. Generally, the front of the show is better than the back; if you stay tuned after &ldquo;Weekend Update&rdquo;, you should count yourself a long-time fan, willing to see some weird and/or flat skits, or asleep on the couch.</p>
<p>If you zoom out to look at how a season flows, you&rsquo;ll again find shows that are really great and some that aren&rsquo;t. My theory is that this entirely depends on the quality of the host. A mediocre host seems to bring middling material out of the writers and performers. A good or high-profile host seems to bring good-but-not-great material and pretty good performances. One of the darling hosts, like Alec Baldwin and the more recent Jon Hamm, brings the A-game material from the writers and performers play up to the occasion.</p>
<p>Interestingly, musical guests can bring a certain electricity too. Paul Rudd is a capable host, but pairing him with Paul McCartney led to a show that was pretty electric. I defy you to watch that episode and tell me SNL just isn&rsquo;t as good as it used to be.</p>
<p>Zooming out to look at successive seasons, you see the same sort of up-and-down. Will Ferrell&rsquo;s first season was good, but not great. He definitely left at his sketch comedy peak, and the show was briefly weaker for it. But right on his heels came the Fey/Poehler/Rudolph powerhouse. There&rsquo;s an ebb and flow as casts come together, hammer out a few good seasons, and then move on to other stages.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That&rsquo;s how I understand SNL. Perhaps I&rsquo;m seeing cognitive biases towards the show through my own cognitive biases. I think it&rsquo;s still a relevant benchmark of American pop culture.</p>

			 <p>This is about how TextMate&rsquo;s bundle mechanism was brilliant, but subtly flawed. However, to make that point, I need to drag you through a dichotomy of developer tools.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ford identifies Maven and IDEs like Eclipse as tools that rely on contextual extension to get developer started with specific tasks very quickly. On the other hand, a composable tool exchange task-oriented focus for greater adaptability.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And thus, the crux of the biscuit:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Contextual tools are great right up to the point you hit the wall of the original developer&rsquo;s imagination. To proceed past that point requires a leap of one or two orders of magnitude in effort or complexity to achieve your goal which the original developer never intended.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ford wrote this as a follow-on to a piece Martin Fowler wrote about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how one extends their text edior<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It turns out that the extension models of popular text editors, such as VIM and Emacs, are more like composable systems than extension-based systems.</p>
<p>All of this is a extremely elaborate setup for me to sing the praise of TextMate. Amongst the many things it got very right, TextMate brilliantly walked the line between a nerdy programmer&rsquo;s editor and an opinionated everyday tool for a wide range of developers. It did this by exposing its extension mechanism through two tools that every developer knows: scripts and regular expressions.</p>
<p>To add functionality to TextMate, you make a bundle. A bundle is a convention for laying out a directory such that TextMate knows the difference between a template and a syntax definition through a convention. This works because developers know how to put things in the right folder. There were only ever five or so folders you needed to know about, so this was a simple mechanism that didn&rsquo;t become a burden.</p>
<p>To tell TextMate how to parse a language and do nifty things like folding text, you wrote a bunch of regular expressions. If I recall, there were really only a few placeholders to wedge in these regular expressions. This worked great, as most languages, though the &ldquo;serious&rdquo; tools use lexers and parsers, are amenable to low-fidelity comprehension with a series of naive pattern matches. The downside was that languages that didn&rsquo;t look like C were sometimes odd to work with.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the real beauty of TextMate&rsquo;s bundles was that all of the behavioral enhancement was handled with shell scripts. Plain-old Unix. You could write them in Ruby, Python, bash, JavaScript, whatever fit your fancy. As long as you could read environment variables and output text (or even HTML), you could make TextMate do new things. This led to an absolute explosion of functionality provided by the community. It was a great thing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Interestingly enough, TextMate is essentially a runtime for bundles. This is how VIM and Emacs are structured as well. TextMate just put a nicer interface around that bundle runtime. However, the way it did so was its downfall, at least for me.</p>
<p>Recall, a few hundred words ago, the difference between composable and contextual extensions. A contextual extension is easy to get going, but comes up short when you imagine something the creator of the extension point didn&rsquo;t imagine. The phenomenal thing about TextMate was how well it chose the extension points and how much further those extension points took the program than what came before it. I&rsquo;d estimate that about 90% of what TextMate ever needed to do, you could do with bundles. But the cost to find that last 10%, it was brutal.</p>
<p>Eventually, I bumped up against this limitation with TextMate. I wanted split windows, I wanted full-screen modes, I wanted better ctags integration. No one could add those (when TextMate wasn&rsquo;t open source, circa 2010) because they required writing Objective-C rather than using TextMate&rsquo;s extension mechanism. And so, I ended up on a different editor (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->after<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->several<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->months<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wandering<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->philosophical<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->desert<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If possible, you should choose a composable extension mechanism (a full-blown language, probably) and use that extension mechanism to implement your system, ala Vimscript/VIM and elisp/Emacs. If you can&rsquo;t do that, you can get most of the benefit by doing a plugin API, but you have to choose the extension points <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> well.</p>

<p>In my few visits to San Francisco, I&rsquo;ve found that I cannot wrap my Texan brain around that town. Trying to really understand its startup culture with just a few visits to the city and Palo Alto is similarly folly. But I did notice the intensity that SF has. It&rsquo;s not a bad way to describe the town.</p>
<p>That said, I think this is a pretty decent encapsulation of Austin. Austin is a slower town (slower even than Dallas) and revels in the variety of activities available to its people. The Austin tech community is more about smaller groups and individuals too. It&rsquo;s not (always) about aim-for-the-stars startups or working for large companies using large technology from large vendors. It&rsquo;s as much about a few people on a team or individuals hacking something out while enjoying their city, family, and friends.</p>
<p>Obviously, I dig that a lot.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I should mention that, while it&rsquo;s popular to write Austin off as a slacker town, there&rsquo;s a lot of people dedicated to their work and craft here. It&rsquo;s not all tacos and BBQ. The events I go to most often are frequented by people who using their evenings to learn something new or talk shop while they&rsquo;re <!-- raw HTML omitted -->making<!-- raw HTML omitted --> something. That is, I think, the most important factor of a startup community: the more people who are putting their evenings into making things, the more likely those things will end up awesome and grow into a business-like organism.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->From a monolithic Ruby on Rails app to the JVM<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, how Soundcloud has transitioned to a hybrid approach with Ruby apps intermingling with Scala and Clojure apps. I think some of their idea of what is idiomatic Rails and how to operate Ruby are not exactly on center. But, their approach to the problem of a large Rails app is right on: break it up into &ldquo;micro-services&rdquo; that, if you don&rsquo;t like the code, you can rewrite quickly if necessary.</p>
<p>Lest you fear this is yet another &ldquo;Rails doesn&rsquo;t scale!&rdquo; deck, they do make a key observation. &ldquo;Rails, PHP, etc. are a very good choice to start something&rdquo;. Once you get past &ldquo;starting&rdquo; and &ldquo;growing&rdquo; to &ldquo;successful and challenging&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll face the same level of challenge no matter what you choose: Ruby or Java, MySQL or Riak.

			 <p>I use Alfred because I believe that my computer should be practically unusable to other people who try to use it. My goal is to put the things I use frequently close at hand. Conversely, the things I use rarely should be accessible without cluttering my most common workflows.</p>
<p>Last week, I came up with a way to bring the two or three applications I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all the time<!-- raw HTML omitted --> very close to hand. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the double tap:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since I use VIM inside a terminal several hours a day, I want really quick access to iTerm 2. My thumb just happens to sit near the command key all day. Ergo, assigning a key to quickly switch to the terminal makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>But it gets even better! Alfred knows about double-taps of the control, alt, and command keys. So you can assign an application to each of those keys and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really quickly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> switch back and forth between them. It&rsquo;s pretty rad.</p>
<p>My experience is that this works exactly how I&rsquo;d want it to 80% of the time. A couple times a day, I will start to chord a different key combo and mysteriously end up in iTerm. It&rsquo;s not disruptive, just a little odd at first, and I keep going about my business.</p>
<p>If you use Alfred with the Powerpack and love your keyboard, you should definitely start using double-taps.</p>

			 <p>We tell ourselves, &ldquo;a computer only does what we tell it to.&rdquo; But, when it comes down to it, if we aren&rsquo;t getting the result we want out of the computer, we often give in and do whatever it is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->computer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> wants us to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by this phenomenon. Novices do it when they&rsquo;re confused, even a little afraid they may have done something wrong. Experts do it when they&rsquo;re frustrated and upset that the computer is preventing them from doing whatever it is they actually wanted to do.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it say about our increasingly dependent relationship with computers? At what point do we give up on our own goal and do what the computer wants so we can make progress? Is it really computers we&rsquo;re giving into, or the dysfunction of the relationship between the designer, developer and the user of a computer?</p>

			 <p>Data point: a few of the infrastructure pieces out of Twitter have been implemented in low-level, heavy metal C and they&rsquo;re optimizing on individual machines instead of architecture. Today, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->twitter/fatcache<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a memcached-on-SSDs:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to observe Twitter&rsquo;s architectural growth from the outside. They quickly exceeded the capacity of typical MySQL setups, then of Ruby and Rails, then memcached alone. They&rsquo;ve got distributed filesystems, streaming distributed processing pipelines, and distributed databases. Now they&rsquo;re optimizing down to the utilization of their hardware, taking advantage of the memory-like latencies of SSDs. When you start caring about power and the size of your index entries, you&rsquo;ve reached a whole new level of Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of scaling.</p>
<p>If trends continue and Twitter is a leader in how large-scale distributed systems are implemented, watch out. Twitter led many of us to Scala, ZooKeeper, and their own inventions like Storm and Finagle. Gird your programming and scaling fashion loins, because you’re about to learn a lot more about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->malloc<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ERRNO<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and processor architecture than you ever wanted to know!</p>

			 <p>Lessons from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Premature Abstractions Illustrated<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;ve run afoul of all three of these:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Don’t let your technical solution influence your design decisions. It’s the tool that needs to fit the job, not the other way round.</p>
<p>Don’t build abstractions as long as you have no proven idea on how the levels below that abstraction will look like.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I could have used an outside, trusted voice to gently reel me in if when I went off into the unproductive weeds. Someone to ask &ldquo;how will this help the team in two weeks?&rdquo;, someone to point out ideas that might be great but have only achieved greatness in my head. A person who is asking questions because they want me to succeed, not because they&rsquo;re trying to take me down a notch.</p>
<p>I have rushed into implementing the first idea in my head. Sometimes I&rsquo;ve convinced myself that my first idea is the best, despite knowing I need to review it from more angles. I&rsquo;ve jumped into projects with a shiny new tool and a bunch of optimism, only to cut myself on a sharp edge later on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve built systems that look fine on their own, but don&rsquo;t fit into the puzzle around them. I&rsquo;ve isolated myself building up that system, afraid to figure out how to fit my system into the puzzle in a useful way. I&rsquo;ve used mocks and stubs to unintentionally isolate myself from the real system.</p>
<p>Basically, these are all really good ways to paint yourself into a corner. It seems like being in a corner with a shiny new system/tool/abstraction would be nice. Unfortunately, my experience is that once you have to make sense of that abstraction in a team, things get dicey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dangerous to run a software project on your own! Take a friend.</p>

<p>I love this bicycle metaphor. The slowness of biking engages my brain in an entirely different way than running or driving. Even the mechanical sounds are more pleasant; the consistent whirr of the chain is so much more calming than the revving up and down of a gasoline engine.</p>
<p>The value of typing code holds very true for me; I usually get very little by simply reading code in books and articles.

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Systems tends toward disorder. Disorder is hard to reason about and risky to deal with, i.e. you&rsquo;re likely to avoid dealing with it at all. But, most successful products have a system with more technical debt than you&rsquo;d like at its center.</p>
<p>Increasingly, I think that the only way to confront technical debt and complexity is to contain it. Languages and tools only seem to help at the margin. Rigorously splitting large, complex, debt-filled systems into smaller, proportionally complex and debt-filled systems is the way to gain traction.</p>

			 <p>How much easier would Haskell be if its vocabulary wasn&rsquo;t so deeply rooted in abstract mathematics? How many more people would immediately understand Cassandra if it just adopted the vernacular of row-oriented databases instead of overriding it with column-oriented semantics? Wouldn&rsquo;t the programming world be better if every language didn&rsquo;t call itself object-oriented?</p>
<p>So many programmer-facing things could be better if they had better names for concepts. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The power of good naming<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The cynical view is, we are actively confusing and inhibiting ourselves when we use names that are too short, not clear, or outright wrong. The optimistic view is that there&rsquo;s a progression we can take from not knowing what something should be named, to giving it an acceptable name, to using the naming process to discover better structures.</p>
<p>If you ever hear me say something &ldquo;needs better words&rdquo;, it means that I think the idea is right but the labels are wrong. A philosophical dialog may ensue, where I struggle to discover what the essence of the idea is. The end goal is a word that is concise, has the right connotation, and whose meaning is obvious and accessible to as many audiences as possible.</p>

			 <p>Wise pal Brain Bailey, along the way to writing about Woody Allen, perfectly articulates my challenge in thinking about how a team should work:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the other hand, a clear goal with little freedom in how to achieve it produces uninspired work by dispirited people. The lack of freedom is experienced as a lack of trust and confidence. People in these environments will eventually seek out new places to work.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Personally, I oscillate between attributing failed projects to too much freedom or not enough freedom. It&rsquo;s not about that at all. It&rsquo;s about the balance of that freedom and clarity. If I&rsquo;m given freedom without clarity, I run off and invent something interesting but impractical. If I&rsquo;m given over-constrained clarity, I get discouraged.</p>
<p>(Freedom is a funny thing on teams and projects. I have a lot more freedom than I usually think, but I&rsquo;m still very conservative in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->acting<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on that freedom.)</p>
<p>I recently asked my team lead to give the team I&rsquo;m on a stronger direction in which to go. We already had most of the freedom we needed. We talked over how we could proceed as a team and came up with a direction that was useful for the other teams around us and not so far afield from our current momentum as to discourage us. My morale immediately doubled and I think our team did some good excellent work once we had that strong direction.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re managing yourself, managing a team, or managing your manager, asking for clarity is a thing I you should do!</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Theory and Practice<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is about a fence. It&rsquo;s tempting to steer all the way towards the abstract, academic side, or all the way towards cutthroat practical side. Some of the most intriguing, productive people I&rsquo;ve known sit on either side. Both sides like to accuse the other of not producing results, but that&rsquo;s subjective. An academic&rsquo;s results are wholly different from a practitioner&rsquo;s results.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is a really nice way of explaining why someone like Richard Feynman is awesome. He was equal parts discoverer and explainer (plus another equal part mischief). This is exactly the thing I aim to achieve when I write here, make code, or present at conferences. There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of ideas that aren&rsquo;t in practice but, presented and packaged properly, can help move a lot of practitioners forward while recognizing the work of academics and nudging them to keep working in that area.</p>
<p>A lot of good things come out of connecting the people on opposite sides of the fence. Sitting on a fence isn&rsquo;t exactly graceful, but sometimes it&rsquo;s the only way to move ideas along. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to eschew purity or pride for progress.</p>

			 <p>The give a penny, take a penny jar is a logical conundrum. It is not, on its surface, a rational thing. I have no data, but I suspect very few people who put money into them are doing so because they plan on taking money out later. A bank is different from a give/take a penny jar.</p>
<p>Personally, I put money in because I can and because I fancy myself <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not a jerk<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The latter is what makes more rational sense. I put money in because it&rsquo;s utility to me is marginal, but the utility of feeling better about myself is non-marginal.</p>
<p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My Blue Heaven<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Steve Martin plays a semi-reformed mobster in the witness protection program. He starts compiling a book of his truisms for living life. One is &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not so much tipping I believe in as over-tipping.&rdquo; His character does this partially because he&rsquo;s a little flashy, and partially, I think, because he has to be a likable protagonist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to be a likable protagonist too, but I like over-tipping whenever possible for another reason. Pretty much anyone who works for tips is working really hard for every dollar they make. An extra dollar here or there is trivial to someone with a desk-job like myself, but less trivial to tip-earners who are technically paid less than minimum wage. An extra five or ten percent on a single tip won&rsquo;t change their life, but it probably doesn&rsquo;t hurt either.</p>
<p>I like making people&rsquo;s day better with laughs and smiles, but I&rsquo;m not above buying a tiny fraction of a better day for someone else. Marginal pennies and dollars add up.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;&quot;People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.&quot; Alan Kay, creator of Smalltalk, object-oriented programming, and many other things that are good in your software development life, said that.&lt;/li&gt;

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think Alan Kay&rsquo;s quote could be rewritten for modern times to say, &ldquo;Those who are really serious about large applications should make their own datacenters&rdquo;. Assembling hardware, putting it into racks, putting the racks into data centers, and building out your own data centers are the analog of building your own hardware for software service companies these days.</p>
<p>You probably don&rsquo;t need expert-level knowledge of these disciplines to write software today (e.g. I know diddly-squat about how packets find their way through the modern internet). You will, however, have a leg up if you&rsquo;re aware of the possibilities and know how to take advantage of them. Even if you&rsquo;re building applications with modest capacity needs, knowing how to set up a failover database and when to pay for physical hardware instead of virtualized hosts is a thing that will make your customers and clients happy.</p>
<p>More concisely: when it comes to running your software on hardware, one size does not fit all; know how and when to tailor your application to the hardware, no matter what size your application wears.</p>

<p>The great thing about Rails and Sinatra was that they boiled previously conceptually heavy domains down to a simpler, better set of ideas. In doing so, they move you up the hierarchy of needs, so to speak, and you still end up inventing your own concepts and nouns. More on that soon!</p>

<p>It promotes distributed and decentralized topologies without single points of failure, enabling fault tolerance and high availability coupled with a reliable message delivery guarantee.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>No SPOFs and reliable message delivery, without relying on something like ZooKeeper, is a big claim. They have some novel approaches to these problems.</p>
<p>First, they run an intermediary daemon, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nsqlookupd<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, between the producers/consumers and the actual queues. These daemons monitor all the available queue servers and tell the clients what to connect to. No configuration of actual queue servers is known to applications. They then run multiple lookup daemons, which are stateless and don&rsquo;t need to agree with each other in order for the system to operate properly.</p>
<p>Reliable message delivery is provided with at-least-once message delivery semantics. They require all consumers to de-duplicate messages or restrict their operations to idempotent operations. Not exactly legacy friendly, as many applications are coded with the assumption of a closed, one-shot world. But. Idempotence: I highly recommend it if you have the means.</p>
<p>If you need to prevent losing messages due to the FBI stealing your servers, which is something you definitely need to account for, you can set up redundant pairs of servers and rely on deduplication/idempotence to make sure you&rsquo;re only processing messages once, even if you consume them multiple times.</p>
<p>In summary: lots of good ideas here. Perhaps some of them could be applied to how people are using Resque?</p>

Pedro Belo, of Heroku fame, finds Rails is way better for pure-web apps and Sinatra is way better for pure-API apps. Most of it comes down to Rails has better tooling and Sinatra is better for scratching itches, which happens a lot more in APIs than applications. I&rsquo;m not ready to pronounce this the final word, but what he&rsquo;s saying lines up with much of my experience.</p>
<p>That said, you can get pretty far with a Rails API by segregating it from your application.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One black-and-white perspective on building software is that part of it is about mechanics and part of it is about science. The mechanics part is about wiring things up, composing smaller solutions into bigger ones, and solving any problems that arise in the process. The science part is taking problems that don&rsquo;t fit well into the existing mechanisms and making a new mechanism that identifies and solves all the right puzzles.</p>
<p>You could look at visual and interaction design in the same way. The mechanical part is about using the available assets and mechanisms to create a visual, interactive experience on screens that humans interact with. The science is about solving a problem using ideas that people already understand or creating an idea that teaches people how to solve a problem.</p>
<p>The mechanical case is about knowing tools, when to use them, and how they interact with each other. The scientific case is about holding lots of state and puzzle in your head and thinking about how computers or people will interact with the system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve observed that people end up all long the spectrum. Some specialize on mechanics, others on science. The rare case that can work adeptly on both sides, even if they&rsquo;re not the best at either discipline, is really fun to watch.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to divorce reason, emotion, and making progress on a project. Letting a logical inconsistency go is harder than forcing someone to see the flaw in their reasoning. Getting angry or worked-up feels more powerful than a supportive attitude. There are so many disasters to avoid, it&rsquo;s hard to not to force everyone to listen to all the things you&rsquo;ve been burned by previously and how you want to avoid them at all costs.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath. Fire up your empathy muscles. Figure out how to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the work of your teammates while using your experience to guide that work to an even better place. This is what they call &ldquo;constructive teamwork&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Get Rid of That Code Smell - Primitive Obsession<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Rails developers can fall into another kind of obsession: framework obsession. Rails gives you folders for models, views, controllers, etc. Everything has to be one of those. Logic is shoehorned into models instead of put in objects unrelated to persistence. Controller methods and helpers grow huge with conditionals and accreted behavior.</p>
<p>This is partially an education and advocacy problem. Luckily, folks like Avdi Grimm, Corey Haines, Gary Bernhardt, and Steve Klabnik, amongst others, are spreading the word of how to use object oriented principles to design Rails applications without obsessing over the constructs in the Rails framework.</p>
<p>The second part is practice. Once you&rsquo;ve educated yourself and bought into the notion that a Rails app isn&rsquo;t all Rails classes, you&rsquo;ve got to practice and struggle with the concepts. It won&rsquo;t be pretty the first time; at least, it wasn&rsquo;t for me. But with time, I&rsquo;ve come to feel far better about how I design applications using both Rails principles and object-oriented principles.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have thought all the useful things to say about Etsy were said, at this point, but I&rsquo;d have thought wrong!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good saying about designing distributed systems that goes something like &ldquo;avoid it as long as possible&rdquo;. I think these three guidelines are worth adding to that saying. Iterate, examine, repeat. Don&rsquo;t make big, tricky changes. In fact, large change you can&rsquo;t recover from are nearly impossible to make anyway, so route around them entirely.</p>
<p>The last bit, &ldquo;promote learning&rdquo;, is great too. I follow distributed systems and database designers on Twitter and see tons of great papers and ideas in the exchange. More than that, always teach your teammates about the distributed systems you&rsquo;re building. The more they know about the design and constraints of the system you&rsquo;re making, the easier it is for them to work with those systems. If you can&rsquo;t teach someone to use your system, you probably don&rsquo;t understand it well enough.</p>

<p>The only rub I can see is that, as far as I can tell, he&rsquo;s talking about making this the default for production mode. Making it the default for development mode isn&rsquo;t tenable if you want to keep class reloading around, which almost everyone does. It&rsquo;s just a hunch, but running without thread-safety in development seems weird when its the default in production.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Building a concurrent system isn’t as hard as they say it is. What it boils down to is, you can’t program by coincidence. Here’s a list of qualities in a strong developer:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Today, I want to give you a starting point for tinkering with and understanding concurrent programs, particularly in modern Ruby (JRuby and Rubinius 2.0).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If process concurrency is the only available trick, running a Resque-style job queue works. But now that thread concurrency is viable with Ruby, we can look at handling these same kind of jobs in-process instead of externally. At the cost of some additional code and additional possible states in our process, we save all sorts of operational complexity.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>def call(message)
puts message
end</p>
<p>end
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Simple enough. Now let’s make this thing actually work!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>module Work
@queue = Queue.new
@n_threads = 2
@workers = []
@running = true</p>
<p>Job = Struct.new(:worker, :params)
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
First off, we pull in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thread<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which gives us <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thread<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and our new best friend, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Queue<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We also need <!-- raw HTML omitted -->timeout<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so we have a way to interrupt methods that block.</p>
<p>Then we define our global work queue, aptly named <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Work<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It’s got a modest amount of state: a queue to store pending work on, a parameter for the number of threads (I went with two since my MacBook Air has two <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cores), an array to keep track of the worker threads, and a flag that indicates whether the work queue should keep running.</p>
<p>Finally, we define a little job object, because schlepping data around inside a library with a hash is suboptimal. Data that represents a concept deserves a name and some structure!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>def start
@workers = @n_threads.times.map { Thread.new { process_jobs } }
end
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This is the heart of the API. Note the use of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->module_function<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with no arguments; this makes all the following methods attach to the module object like class methods. This saves us the tedium of typing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->self.some_method<!-- raw HTML omitted --> all the time. Happy fingers!</p>
<p>Users of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Work<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will add new jobs with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->enqueue<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, just like Resque. It’s a lot simpler in our case, though, because we never have to cross process boundaries. No marshaling, no problem.</p>
<p>Once the queue is loaded up (or even if it’s not), users then call <!-- raw HTML omitted -->start<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This fires up a bunch of threads and starts processing jobs. We need to keep track of those threads for later, so we toss them into a module instance variable.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>More importantly, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@queue.pop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will block, forever, if the queue is empty. That makes it easy for us to avoid hogging the CPU fruitlessly looking for new work. It does, however, mean we need to wrap the pop operation in a timeout, so that we can eventually get back to our loop and do some housekeeping.</p>
<p>Housekeeping task the first, run that job. This looks almost just like the code you’ll find inside Resque workers. Create a new instance of the class that handles this job, invoke our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->call<!-- raw HTML omitted --> interface, pass the job params on. Easy!</p>
<p>Housekeeping task the second, see if the worker should keep running. If the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@running<!-- raw HTML omitted --> flag is still set, we’re good to continue consuming work off the queue. If not, something has signaled that it’s time to wrap up.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>def stop
@running = false
@workers.each(&amp;:join)
end</p>
<p>end
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Shutting down our work queue is a matter of draining any pending jobs and then closing out the running threads. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->drain<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a little oddly named. It doesn’t actually do the draining, but it does block until the queue is drained. We use it as a precondition for calling <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stop<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which tells all the workers to finish the job they’ve got and then exit their processing loop. We then call <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thread#join<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to shutdown the worker threads.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h1 id="process-jobs-in-another-threads">Process jobs in another thread(s)</h1>
<p>Work.start</p>
<h1 id="block-until-all-jobs-are-processed">Block until all jobs are processed</h1>
<p>Work.drain</p>
<h1 id="stop-the-workers">Stop the workers</h1>
<p>Work.stop
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Create work, start our workers, block until they finish, and then stop working. Not too bad for fifty lines of code.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What I hope I’ve demonstrated today is that concurrent programming, even in Ruby with all its implementation shortcomings, is approachable. To wit:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I hope you see the ease with which we can get started doing concurrent Ruby programming by learning just two new classes. Don’t fear the threads, friend!&lt;/</p>

<p>There are plenty of code metric gizmos out there. At a glance, Hopper takes a few nice steps over extant projects. Unlike previous tools, it has a clear design, an obvious extension mechanism, and the analysis tools are distinct from the reporting tools. Further, it&rsquo;s designed to run out-in-the-open, on existing open source projects. This makes it immediately useful and gives it a ton of data to work with.</p>

<p>This, to me, is an interesting juxtaposition. Normally, I think of bugs as things that should all be fixed, eventually. Putting some scarcity of labor into them is a great idea. Fixing bugs is great, until it negatively affects morale. Better to address the most critical and pressing bugs and then move the product ball forward. A mechanism to limit the number of bugs to fix, plus the feedback loop of recognizing those who fix bugs in an iteration (they mention this elsewhere in the article), is a great idea.</p>

<p>This is tricky ground and it&rsquo;s not as win-win as you might think. Integrating a new dependency, whether its one maintained by a team-mate or not, requires communication. Everyone on the team will have to know about the dependency, how to work with it, and how to maintain it within the project.

			 <p>When it comes to programming editors, frameworks, and languages, you&rsquo;re likely to take one of three stances: marry, boff, or kill. There are tools that you want to use for the rest of your life, tools that you want to moonlight or tinker with, and tools you never want to use again in your life.</p>
<p>Tool antagonism, ranting about the tools you want to kill, is fun. It plays well on internet forums. It goes nicely with beer and friends. But on a team that isn&rsquo;t using absolutely terrible tools, it&rsquo;s a waste of time.</p>
<p>Unless your team is bizarrely like-minded, it&rsquo;s likely some disagreement will arise along the lines of editors, frameworks, and languages. I&rsquo;ve been that antagonistic guy. We can&rsquo;t use this language, it has an annoying feature. We can&rsquo;t use this framework, it doesn&rsquo;t protect us from an annoying kind of bug. I&rsquo;ve learned these conversations are a waste of social capital and unnecessarily divisive. Don&rsquo;t be that guy.</p>
<p>There are usually a few tools that are appropriate to a given task. I often have a preference and choose specific tools for my personal projects. There are others tools that I&rsquo;m adept at using or have used before, but find minor faults with. I&rsquo;ve found it way better for me to accept that other, non-preferred tool if it&rsquo;s already in place or others have convictions about using it. Better to put effort into making the project or product better than spinning wheels on programming arcanery.</p>
<p>When it comes to programmer tools, rational agnosticsm beats antagonism every time. Train yourelf to work amazingly-great with a handful of tools, reach adeptness with a few others, and learn how to think with as many tools as possible.</p>

			 <p>To some, Rails is getting big. It brings a lot of functionality to the table. This makes apps easier to get off the ground, especially if you aren&rsquo;t an expert. But, as apps grow, it can lead to the pain; there&rsquo;s so much machinery in Rails, it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;re abusing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->something<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s easy to look at other, smaller tools and think there&rsquo;s green grass over there.</p>
<p>Rails 4 might have answers to this temptation.</p>
<p>On the controller side of things, it seems likely that some form of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Strobe&rsquo;s Rails extensions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will find their way into Rails, making it easier to create apps (or sub-apps) that are focused on providing an API and eschew the parts of ActionPack that aren&rsquo;t necessary for services. The thing I like a lot about this idea is it covers a gap between Sinatra and Rails. You can prototype your app with all the conveniences of Rails and then strip out the parts you don&rsquo;t need as you grow the app and strip it down to provide quick services. You could certainly still rewrite services in Sinatra, Grape, or Goliath, but it&rsquo;s nice to have an option.</p>
<p>On the model side of things, people are, well, modeling. Simpler ways to use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->use ActiveModel with ActionPack in Rails<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will appear in Rails 4. The components the DataMapper team is working on, in the form of  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Virtus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seem really interesting too. If you want to get started now, you can check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ActiveAttr<!-- raw HTML omitted --> right now, sort of the bonus track version of ActiveModel. Chris Griego&rsquo;s put a lot of solid thought into this; you definitely want to check out his slides on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->models everywhere<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; they&rsquo;re lurking in your controllers, your requests, your responses, your API clients, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everywhere<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>In short, my best guess on Rails 4, right now, is that it will continue to give developers a curated set of choices and frameworks to get their application off the ground. It will add options to grow your application&rsquo;s codebase sensably once it&rsquo;s proven out.</p>
<p>What I know, for sure, is that the notion of Rails <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seems really strange to me. How fast time flies. Uphill, both ways.</p>

<p>You can almost age generations of programmers like tree rings. I&rsquo;m of the PHP/Rails generation, though I started in the Linux generation.

The Node generation of developers will teach me more still, both in finding new virtuous paths and in going down false paths so I don&rsquo;t have to follow them.</p>
<p>That said, it would be delightful if there was a shortcut to get these new generations past the &ldquo;re-invent all the things!&rdquo; phase and straight into the &ldquo;make useful things and constructive dialog about how they&rsquo;re better&rdquo; phase.</p>

			 <p>Every program, library, framework, and application needs documentation of some sort; this much is uncontroversial. How much documentation, what kinds of documentation, and where to put that documentation are the questions that often elicit endless prognostication.</p>
<p>When it comes to documentation aimed at developers, there&rsquo;s a spectrum. On one end, there&rsquo;s zero documentation, only code. On the other end of the spectrum, are literate programs; the code is intertwined with the documentation and the language is equally geared towards marking up a document and translating ideas into machine executable code.</p>
<p>Somewhere along this spectrum exists a happy ideal for most programmers. Inline API docs ala JavaDoc, RDoc, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->YARD<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have been popular for a while. Lately, tools like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->docco<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rocco<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have raised enthusiasm for &ldquo;semi-literate programming&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s also a lot of potential in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->projects exhaustively documenting themselves in their Cucumber features as vcr does<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>All of these tools couple code with documentation, per the notion that putting them right next to each other makes it more likely documentation gets updated in sync with the code. The downside to this approach is that code gets &lsquo;noised up&rsquo; with comments. Often this is a fair trade, but it occasionally makes navigating a file cumbersome.</p>
<p>It happens that Unix, in its age-old sage ways, has been storing its docs out-of-line with the relevant code for years. They&rsquo;re called manpages, and they mostly don&rsquo;t suck. Every C API on a modern Unix has a corresponding manpage that describes the relevant functions and structures, how to use it, and any bugs that may exist. They&rsquo;re actually a pretty good source of info.</p>
<p>Scene change.</p>
<p>It so happens that Ryan Tomayko is a Unix afficionado and wrote a tool that is even better for writing manpages than the original Unix tooling. It&rsquo;s called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ronn<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it&rsquo;s pretty rad; you write Markdown, and you get bonafide UNIX manpages plus manpage-styled HTML.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a useful way to write programmer-focused docs. Keep docs out of the code, put it in manpages instead, push it to GitHub pages. Code stays focused, docs still look great.</p>
<p>I took <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Nunemaker&rsquo;s scam<!-- raw HTML omitted --> gem and put this idea to the test. Here&rsquo;s what the manpage looks like, with the default styling provided by ronn:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here&rsquo;s the raw ronn document:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->No Ruby files were harmed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the making of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this documentation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>It took me about ninety minutes to put this together. Probably 33-50% of that time was simply tinkering with ronn and making sure I was writing in the style that is typical of manpages. So we&rsquo;re talking about forty-five minutes to document a mixin with seven methods. For pretty good looking output and simple tooling, that&rsquo;s a very modest investment.</p>
<p>The potential drawbacks are the same as any kind of documentation; it could fall out-of-sync with the production code. Really, I think this is more of a workflow issue. Ideally, every commit or merged branch is reviewed to make sure that relevant docs are updated. As a baseline, the release workflow for a project should include a step to make sure docs are up-to-date.</p>
<p>In short, I have one datapoint that tells me that ronn is a pretty great way to generate programmer-oriented documentation. I&rsquo;ll keep tinkering with it and encourage other developers to do the same.</p>

			 <p>Noel Rappin encourages all of us to use our development tools efficiently. If your editor or workflow aren&rsquo;t working for you, get a new tool and learn to use it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with another principle lately: minimize moving parts. I used to spend time setting up tools like autotest, guard, or spork. But it ended up that I spent too much time tweaking them or, even worse, figuring out exactly how they were working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve since adopted a much simpler workflow. Just a terminal, a text editor, and some scripts/functions/aliases/etc. for running the stuff I do all the time. I take note when I&rsquo;m doing something repeatedly and figure out how I can automate it. Besides that, I don&rsquo;t spend much time thinking about my tools. I spend time thinking about the problem in front of me. It makes a lot of sense, when you think about it.</p>
<p>I say you should &ldquo;own&rdquo; your tools and minimize moving parts because you should <!-- raw HTML omitted -->understand<!-- raw HTML omitted --> how they all work together and how they might change the behavior of your code. If you don&rsquo;t own your tools in this way, you&rsquo;ll end up wasting time debugging someone else&rsquo;s code, i.e. a misbehaving tool. That&rsquo;s just a waste of time; when you come across a tool that offends in this way, put aside a time block to fix it, or discard it outright.</p>

			 <p>Jesse Storimer has great thoughts on code review and pairing. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You Should be Doing Formal Code Review<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I struggle with this so much, on both the giving and receiving side. When I&rsquo;m reviewing code, I find myself holding back so as not to come off as saying the other person&rsquo;s code is awful and offensive. On the receiving side, I often get frustrated and feel like a huge impediment has been put in front of my ability to ship code. In reality, neither is the case. Whether I&rsquo;m the reviewer or the reviewee, the other party is simply trying to get the best code possible into production.</p>
<p>Jesse has further great points: review helps you avoid shortcuts, encourages one to review their own code (my favorite), and it makes for better code.</p>
<p>More recently, Jesse&rsquo;s pointed out that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pairing isn&rsquo;t necessarily a substitute for code review<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: &ldquo;&hellip;pairing is heavyweight and rare. Code review is lightweight and always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In my experience, pairing is great for cornering a problem and figuring out what the path to the solution is. Pairing is great for bringing people into the fold of a new team or project. Review is great for enforcing team standards and identifying wholly missing functionality. Review is sometimes great for finding little bugs, as is pairing.</p>
<p>Neither pairing or code review is a silver bullet for better software, but when a team applies them well, really awesome things can happen.</p>

			 <p>Rails is missing an abstraction when it comes to building REST APIs, in my opinion. Requests route through controllers, controllers call models or services to obtain the right objects. And then…you awkwardly try to bang a JSON object together with an ERB template? It gets awkward quickly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of experimentation in the wild attempting to figure out what works well here. You can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bang out a bunch of presenter classes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->describe and compose representations<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can go <!-- raw HTML omitted -->resource oriented<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I came across one yesterday that immediately caught my eye. You could <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just use <code>lambda</code><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to implement a bunch of functions that present, decorate, or map objects from one representation to another. To borrow an example:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I love that this one adds no machinery and no state. Input, function, output. With just <code>lambda</code>, you can describe a bunch of transformations and string them together into meaningful and interesting pipelines.

			 <p>Herein, some great technical writings from the past week or two.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vim: revisited<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, on how to approach Vim and build your very own config from first principles. My personal take on editor/shell configurations is that its way better to have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->someone else<!-- raw HTML omitted --> maintain them. Find something like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Janus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->oh-my-zsh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, tweak the things it includes to work for you, and get back to doing what you do. That said, I&rsquo;m increasingly tempted to craft my own config, if only to promote the fullness and shine of my neck beard.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Making the Netflix API More Resilient<!-- raw HTML omitted --> lays out the system of circuit breakers, dashboards, and automatons Netflix uses to proactively maintain API reliability in the face of external failures. Great ideas anyone maintaining a service that needs to stay online.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->List All of the Riak Keys<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, on the trickiness of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SELECT * FROM all_the_things<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-style queries in Riak, or any distributed database, really. The short story is that these kinds of queries are impractical and not something you can do in production. The longer story is that there are ways to work around it with clever use of indexes and data structures. Make sure you check out the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Riak Handbook<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from the same author.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Introducing Knockbox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> introduces a Clojure library for dealing with conflict resolution in data stored in distributed databases like Riak. If you&rsquo;re working with any database that leaves you wondering what to do when two clients get in a race condition, these are the droids you&rsquo;re looking for. I would have paid pretty good money to have known about this a few months ago.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clojure&rsquo;s Mini-languages<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a great teaser on Clojure if, like me, you&rsquo;ve tinkered with it before but are coming back to it. This is particularly useful if you&rsquo;ve seen some Lisp or Scheme before, but are slightly confused by what&rsquo;s going on with all the non-paren characters that appear in your typical Clojure program. Having taken a recent dive into the JVM ecosystem, I have to say there&rsquo;s a lot to like in Clojure. If your brain understands static types but thinks better in dynamic types (mine does), give this a look.</p>

<p>I occasionally post <!-- raw HTML omitted -->links with shorter comments<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, if you&rsquo;d like a slightly more-frequent dose of what you just read.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wrote on &ldquo;quality&rdquo; a few months ago<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I was thinking of it as an attribute one would use to describe the outer loop of a project. Do a bunch of work, locate areas that need more quality, but a few touches on those areas or note improvements for the next iteration, and ship it.</p>
<p>But what Brad is describing is putting quality into the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->inner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> loop. Work attains &ldquo;the quality&rdquo; as it is created, rather than as a secondary editing or review step. Little is done without considering its quality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m extrapolating a bit from the letter of what Brad has written here, but that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to work with him. Indeed Brad&rsquo;s work is of consistently high quality. Hopefully he&rsquo;ll write more specifics about how quality code is created in the future (hint, Brad), and how much it relates to Christopher Alexander&rsquo;s &ldquo;quality without a name&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>Everyone brings unique perspective to a team. Each person has learned from successes and failures. There is a spectrum of things that are highly valued and that are strongly avoided and each team member is a different point on that spectrum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to bikeshed decisions. Everyone should feel free to share their ideas if they have something useful and constructive to contribute. High-functioning teams share assets and liabilities, so naturally they should share and discuss ideas.</p>
<p>That said, teams don&rsquo;t exist for rhetorical indulgence. They exist to get shit done. Teams have to get all the ideas on the floor, decide what is practical, and move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>If there isn&rsquo;t an outstanding consensus, the tie breaker is simple: the person who ends up doing the work makes the call. That&rsquo;s not to say they should go cowboy and do whatever they want; they should use their knowledge of the &ldquo;situation on the ground&rdquo; to figure out what is most practical. With responsibility comes the right to pick a resolution.</p>

			 <p>Igor Stravinsky&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Rite of Spring<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is an amazing piece of classical music. It&rsquo;s one of the rare pieces that was really revolutionary in its time. But in our time, almost one hundred years on, it doesn&rsquo;t sound that different.</p>
<p>Music has moved on. We are used to the odd times of &ldquo;Take Five&rdquo; and the dissonant horns of a John Williams soundtrack. Music offending the status quo is nothing unheard of.</p>
<p>To enjoy Rite of Spring in its proper context, you have to forget all that. Put yourself in the shoes of a Parisian in 1913, probably well off. You probably just enjoyed a Monet and a coffee. But your world is changing. Something about workers revolting. A transition from manual labor to mechanical labor.</p>
<p>Now imagine yourself at the premier for this new ballet from Russia. You being a Parisian, you&rsquo;re probably expecting something along the lines of Debussy or perhaps Debussy or Berlioz.</p>
<p>Instead, you get <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mild dissonance<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and then <!-- raw HTML omitted -->total chaos<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The changing time signatures, the dissonance, the subject of virgin sacrifice. You&rsquo;d probably riot too!</p>

<p>So the trick with hyperbole is that I might make an exagerated statement to move things along. But the other people in the conversation might think I actually mean what I said. Maybe they understand the thought behind the hyperbole, but maybe I end up unintentionally derailing the conversation.

<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried either of these because, of course, they came out the same week I bite the bullet and write a shell script to automate it on my projects.

			 <p>No program was ever made better by one developer scoffing at another. Computer science does not move forward with condescending attitudes. Success in software isn&rsquo;t the result of looking down your nose or wagging your finger at others.</p>
<p>And yet, if you observe from the outside, you&rsquo;d think that we all live in a wacky world of wonks, one where it&rsquo;s not the facts, but how violently you repeat your talking points that matters the most. The Javascript guys do this in 2011, the Ruby guys did it in 2005, the .NET people before that in 2002, and on down the line.</p>
<p>Civility isn&rsquo;t always what gets you noticed, but if you don&rsquo;t have an outsized ability to focus on technical problems for tens of hours, it sure helps. You&rsquo;re not the most brilliant developer on the planet, but you like to make people laugh, and you like to hang around those who are smarter than me. That&rsquo;s not the recipe for a solid career in programming, but it&rsquo;s a good bridge to get you from the journeyman side of the river over to the side where people think you might know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Once you reach the other side, its a matter of putting in the hours, doing the practice, learning things, and always challenging yourself. Work with the smartest people you can, push yourself to make something better every day. Grind on that enough and you&rsquo;ll get to the point where you really know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Then, you close the loop. You were civil, you didn&rsquo;t piss too many people off. They are eager to hear about the awesome and exciting things you did. So tell them. Even if you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s all that awesome, some will know that you&rsquo;ve got the awesome in you and that it will come out eventually. Some of them aren&rsquo;t your mom!</p>
<p>This is what some call a successful career. It&rsquo;s not so bad, but it&rsquo;s not exactly the extravagant lifestyle you imagined when you were twenty. On the plus side, you do roughly the same things on a daily basis as you did back then, which isn&rsquo;t so bad. Being an adult turns out to be pretty alright.</p>
<p>At some point, you write this advice to yourself on your weblog, except in the second person. Hopefully someone younger, perhaps on the precipice of idolizing a brilliant asshole, will read it and take a more civil path. Maybe you&rsquo;ll get to work with them someday. Let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s not too awkward.</p>

			 <p>Knowing the next step is a pretty good feeling. The uncertainty of where you should next place your foot is somewhere between unnerving and terrifying. But if you&rsquo;ve got an idea of how to proceed, you can learn something. Maybe you&rsquo;re right, maybe you&rsquo;re wrong. It&rsquo;s the step that counts, not so much where you end up.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I just finished reading the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RSpec book<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s a really nicely done book. It does a great job striking a balance between conveying the philosophy of BDD and outside-in development with teaching the tools that Cucumber, RSpec, and Webrat give you when applying that approach to building, delivering, and iterating on software.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m finding most useful about applying those approaches is that I know what the next step is. There&rsquo;s always a missing piece right in front of me. Sometimes its a big thing, a feature-sized piece. Other times it&rsquo;s smaller, a pending spec or a refactoring calling out to me. I&rsquo;m never in the dark, which is important and useful to me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On a whim, I decided to start doing the &ldquo;always keep your email inbox empty&rdquo; thing. I have always been aggressive about making sure everything is read, and I got pretty strict about deleting stuff I&rsquo;ll never need to look at ever again. But now, I file things away (mostly into a shovebox) once I&rsquo;m done with some email.</p>
<p>This is a big deal. It&rsquo;s easy for me to look at my emails and figure out if there is something I&rsquo;ve let slide. If there isn&rsquo;t, I can proceed to doing more interesting things. It&rsquo;s pretty great.</p>
<p>This week, I made a point to &ldquo;clear the decks&rdquo; regularly. If I haven&rsquo;t listened to a podcast, read something in Instapaper, or scanned feeds after a few days, I shove it away. So I can my check email and OmniFocus lists to make sure I didn&rsquo;t miss anything I wanted or need to do. Then I make awesome things. In the evening, I clear out my reading lists in Instapaper and Reeder. I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m always behind. This, too, is pretty great.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s really easy to let all the reverse chronologically sorted lists we allow into our lives dominate our routines. Clearing those lists makes it easy to see what the next step is and get on with learning interesting things and making awesome stuff.</p>

			 <p>My favorite sort of problem involves the interactions between individuals, groups of people, and mechanical rules generated by individuals and groups. Speculating on how the rules were shaped by the experiences of the individuals and groups is a fun game to play when presented with a curious set of circumstances. Conversely, my least favorite problems are those generated by the institutional brain damage of certain kinds of groups. Software and systems shaped by regulations and the particulars of monetary exchange are tedious at best.</p>
<p>I find it quite amusing when answers aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;clean&rdquo; and technological systems aren&rsquo;t the best solution. Often, no amount of analysis and brilliant coding can make an improvement. What is needed is to understand what people do, why they do it, and persuade them to do otherwise.</p>
<p>This brings me to economics, specifically behavioral economics. If you take away all the math, economics is largely about how people behave in aggregate. It&rsquo;s a useful tool in understanding how to work with systems that involve people. But there&rsquo;s more to economics than explaining how people interact in markets.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Russ Roberts, in the process of explaining how economics is not useful as a mechanism for answering questions like &ldquo;did the stimulus work?&rdquo; or &ldquo;when will the housing market recover?&rdquo;, gets to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what really interests me about economics and finance<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The crux of the biscuit, for me, is right in the middle. Economics is a useful way to organize an intricate and interconnected problem and figure out how to reason about it. In casually studying economics and finance over the couple years, I&rsquo;ve come to form a better mental model about how the world works.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Its possible that this mental modeling is what I do when I&rsquo;m coding. I&rsquo;m poking how some code works, looking at its inner workings, trying to understand how it interacts with the code around it. I sift through revision logs to see how it got to where it is today, talk to others on the team about the code and why it ended up one way and not another. I&rsquo;m organizing and modeling the code in my head, building up a model that describes .</p>
<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been describing my work as tinkering with lines of code until numbers appear on the screen in the right order. This is invariably greeted with a comforting-to-me response like &ldquo;I could never do that&rdquo;. But I really enjoy this. I&rsquo;m not just debugging my code; I&rsquo;m sharpening the way the program is organized in my head. Once I&rsquo;ve got my head around it, I decode that organization into words, code, drawings, etc.</p>
<p>With programs, there is some system of rules, forces, and interactions which describe how the code works or doesn&rsquo;t. Economics, too, describes a system of rules, forces, and interactions that predicts how a puzzle of human beings operate. Organizing and decoding these technical and social puzzles is great fun.</p>

			 <p>It is probably obvious I have something of a crush on working out. I am proud I have reached a point where being fit is part of my lifestyle and that I see more and more results. But my crush with exercise goes beyond what I see in the mirror.</p>
<p>As important as the physical aspects are, I get the most out of the mental aspects. Working out mirrors what I do in coding in a couple ways. Both require staying on my grind almost every day. Both require the focus to push myself and resist complacency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to spend too much time tinkering with social media or pick the lighter weights. It&rsquo;s harder to ignore distractions and focus on the task in front of me, whether it&rsquo;s code or heaving kettlebells.</p>
<p>When I do manage to focus I benefit twice. Immediately I feel great because I challenged myself and moved my work or workout forward. Later, I realize I&rsquo;m getting better at putting the work in every day and tuning out that which is not important to what I&rsquo;m trying to do.</p>
<p>The TV infomercial benefits of working out, ripped extremities and a strong core, are a tertiary benefit to developers and creative types. Even the decrease in neck fat, the ability to lift heavy things, and reduced tendency to get winded are auxillary. The real benefit that people who make things get from working out are increased focus and discipline.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Lately, I&rsquo;m a little fascinated by the interplay between focus, momentum, and accomplishment. Focus is the feeling of flow, the world around you fading away. Momentum is the feeling that you&rsquo;re moving things along, getting stuff done. Accomplishment is stepping back, looking at what you&rsquo;ve done, and feeling like you did something good. These factors play out differently in the three activities to which I decide much of my time.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m building software, I&rsquo;ve found that momentum leads to focus, accomplishments yield momentum, but focus does not necessarily yield accomplishments. Yet, the most exciting moments seem to come when I&rsquo;m focused and building momentum. Those times when my attention is fragmented but I&rsquo;m working through a list of stuff that needs to get done doesn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> like accomplishment, but it does seem to get the job done.</p>
<p>Anecodotally, it seems that, by definition, Monday is the day of the week that lacks focus but still possesses some form of accomplishment. It&rsquo;s the sacrificial lamb of the work week.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m reading, writing, and organizing information, I&rsquo;ve found that momentum is not much of a factor. It&rsquo;s all about focus. Stick my head into a cluster of ideas, focus on what I&rsquo;m reading, how I&rsquo;m thinking about it, or how I&rsquo;m writing it back out. Keep the problem state in my head, admitting as few distractions as possible. Come up for air periodically, review my progress, and decide to either continue or move on to other things.</p>
<p>Of these three activities, I&rsquo;ve found that I&rsquo;m most methodical about how I use momentum when I&rsquo;m thinking. It&rsquo;s sort of a rate limiter; after I&rsquo;ve read something particularly dense, I&rsquo;ll immediately do something banal like catch up on social medias. Not sure if this tendency is enhancing or diminishing my thinking.</p>
<p>I spend several hours a week training. The coffee shop (thinking) and the gym (training) are my third place(s). Recently, it feels like I&rsquo;ve leveled up. I had a few consecutive workouts where I was more focused than I&rsquo;ve ever been whilst exercising; no worries about my breathing, or if I was pushing myself too little or too much. From this focus I found momentum. A couple minutes on the treadmill would turn into tens of minutes, then a half hour. One set of strength exercises would blend into the next. I was able to push myself to higher levels of accomplishments. It felt awesome.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I&rsquo;ve found that I need a day off from each of these activities. As awesome as it sounds to have the kind of intensity that lets one make awesome things every day of the week, I&rsquo;ve found it necessary to relax and take time away from coding, thinking, and training. As it turns out relaxation is an important part of a balanced diet of focus, momentum, and accomplishment.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Engineer #2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Thanks Hank. I&rsquo;m pretty proud of it.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Engineer #1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: And you should be! Had one question though. There was something in the request-for-proposals that mentioned some flaw in the previous one where a snub fighter could drop a torpedo through a vent and blow the whole thing up, yeah?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Engineer #2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Yep! Don&rsquo;t you feel bad for the poor schmuck who made that decision?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Engineer #1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Haha, that&rsquo;s a good one Bob. So you fixed that right?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Engineer #2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Oh, definitely. All the exhaust ports are small enough the only thing falling in there is a grain of sand.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Engineer #1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Nice thinking! So, my real question is, what&rsquo;s this giant opening you can fly a large freighter through? And why does it lead right to the station&rsquo;s giant fusion reactor that sits in a room big enough to fly in circles in said large freighter?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Engineer #2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Oh, that? Well, the passage from that room to the surface is where I&rsquo;m going to run all the pipes and wiring that I forget about until the last second. I figure once I&rsquo;m done patching everything together, no pilot would be able to fly through there, even in a snub fighter.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Engineer #1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: And the giant room?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Engineer #2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Oh, you know clients. Always deciding they want something really impressive at the last minute. I figured I&rsquo;d just leave a little extra room in case they come up with something at the last minute.</p>

<p>Need the first or last <!-- raw HTML omitted -->N<!-- raw HTML omitted --> elements from an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Enumerable<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Easy!</p>
<p>[sourcecode language=&ldquo;ruby&rdquo; light=&ldquo;true&rdquo;]

			 <p>The structural problems in American political discourse are legion. Polarized interests, corporate and special interests, the news/hype cycle, and pundits who serve no real political purpose but exist only as media entities. All of it conspires to misdirect discussions of where our country is, where it needs to go, and how to get there.</p>
<p>Underlying all that is a serious problem. There are two sides to every issue (or so we&rsquo;re told), and they cannot fathom each other&rsquo;s position. Empathy is not a characteristic of American politics.</p>
<p>This manifests itself everywhere. Dismissive rhetoric, talking past each other, insulting jabs, moral grandstanding, dehumanizing the other side, binary reasoning, and violent propaganda. Were it the case that conservatives and progressives could understand each others goals, fears, and dreams, these problems would exist on the fringe rather than the mainstream.</p>
<p>Intellectual empathy is a hard thing to come by. We all want to be winners, firmly on the side of the virtuous good. To accept that there is something valid in one&rsquo;s debate opponent is challenging. To go further and accept ambiguity and uncertainty is even more difficult. It would seem that a majority would prefer comfort in wrongness rather than face up to a world where their side is not that of the virtuous good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how one learns these things other than seeking out new ideas and opinions. Even then, there&rsquo;s the intuition to sort the wheat from the chaff, the practice from the principle, the solid thinkers from the eccentrics. Political empathy is perhaps (but hopefully not) the endpoint on an intellectual journey that a pop culture is ill suited to embark upon.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that my grasp on the problem is good enough to suggest solutions. Perhaps humor, perhaps better education, perhaps breaking bread, perhaps more journalists growing a spine. I should hope it happens soon, because I&rsquo;m getting pretty tired of how cynical I am of what politics has become.</p>

			 <p>About a year ago, our garage door was not feeling well. It wouldn&rsquo;t go down on it&rsquo;s own. To close it required my loving embrace. Specifically, I had to lean against it as the door goes down the tracks. I&rsquo;m sure I looked like the &ldquo;mystic&rdquo; trope in the &ldquo;action&rdquo; movie who, at a crucial moment in the action, resurrects the hero so he can go whoop the bad guy.</p>
<p>This is the part about home ownership that sucks the most. I had a strong suspicion this would work out one of two ways. The repair person will come out, look at it for two minutes, bang on something with a hammer a few times and everything works. Easy, cheap. Or, the repair person will look at it, tinker with it, and pronounce the motor dead, to the tune of a few hundred dollars. It ended up being somewhere in between; I think some kind of specialized garage door grease was involved.</p>
<p>I avoid these things because, through hundreds of logical and unintended decisions, I have chosen the life of an extremely specialized knowledge worker. I enjoy making sense of complicated systems that involve people, computers, and uncertainty. I am nearly useless with everything else.</p>
<p>Luckily, ours is an age where that specialization works out pretty well. I am fortunate that I can pay others to worry about typical &ldquo;male&rdquo; tasks like changing the oil on our cars or painting the bedroom (cue applause from the economists in the audience). That said, sometimes the interactions with those folks feels a little odd. I usually have to prefix them with the disclaimer that I am &ldquo;the least handy dude on the planet&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s important to set expectations.</p>
<p>Another thing I&rsquo;ve learned about home ownership is that repairing my garage door will almost certainly be worth every penny I pay for it. I know this because some time ago, we got around to having someone fix our toilet. It would run for quite some time after you flush it. At least thirty minutes. I let this linger because it was easier to not think about spending money on it that it was to do something about it. But, for not too much money, a professional (read: not me) fixed everything. The toilet flushed and stopped running mere moments later.</p>
<p>The psychological release this brought me was incredible. I found myself noticeably happier that our house was less broken. It was like I got a new toy. And exciting, rejuvenated, toilet toy!</p>
<p>&hellip;and that&rsquo;s the worst part about home ownership. That you can sit down and write more than five hundred words on the joy of home repairs. I&rsquo;ve been working with some folks that are several years younger than I am. These events are interesting to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I know that if I were to breach the topic with them, it would confirm to them that I am indeed the lamest trigenarian they&rsquo;ve ever met. I know this because in college, I worked with older dudes and the summer I spent listening to them talking about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pH<!-- raw HTML omitted --> balance of their pools was notably tedious.</p>
<p>So here we are, five hundred words later, telling the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->whole internet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I&rsquo;m the lamest trigenarian they may ever meet. The good news is, everything in my house works. We got it inspected, and we know this with certainty. I highly recommend it if you have the means.</p>

			 <p>Some measure their work in tomatoes. I measure mine in albums and songs.</p>
<p>When it comes time to get stuff done, I match my ambitions to my energy level. Big, uncertain things when I&rsquo;m full of spark and optimism. Tiny, predictable things when I&rsquo;m sapped and ready to check out. The coherence, duration, and novelty of what I&rsquo;m listening to takes me in a different creative directions. I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pandora<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, my own iTunes library, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rdio<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to match my creative mood to a musical mood.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m <!-- raw HTML omitted -->going<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I may not even know where I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->am<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. At best, I know how I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This is when Pandora shines. If I feel funky, I go with a Billy Preston or Meters mix. If I&rsquo;m feeling peppy, I go with RJD2 or Steely Dan. If I&rsquo;m feeling brooding, it&rsquo;s DJ Shadow or Explosions in the Sky. Pandora finds my way musically, I find my way creatively. Teamwork.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an album guy. I like to queue up a coherent piece of music and listen to it all the way through, in order. A good album rewards this. It starts with a bang, proceeds through a middle section where things might get slow, take on minor key, or both. Things clear up, maybe with a light and organized middle piece. The finale brings it all together and ends with something that sticks in my head.</p>
<p>Ideally, I&rsquo;d create this way too. Start at the beginning. Find the crux of the problem space, explore some solutions. Work to some kind of apex where I&rsquo;ve got all the problems solved and all my ducks in a row. Clean up the rough edges, tidy everything up, and ship it as the finale.</p>
<p>Duration is important. A short album (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Treats<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Sleigh Bells, 32 min.; Beethoven&rsquo;s 5th Symphony, 31 min.) is great for tackling a compact but rewarding task in a small timeframe. A medium length album (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Suburbs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Arcade Fire, 60 min.; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Game Theory<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by The Roots, 51 min.) is good when I&rsquo;m starting to feel my groove. When I&rsquo;m feeling more ambitious, a double album is in order (The Beatles <!-- raw HTML omitted -->White Album<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, 96 min., Mahler&rsquo;s 5th Symphony, 72 min.).</p>
<p>My wildcard is Rdio. Rdio is a blessing for me as a music service. It is very much based on systemic album listening, as opposed to Pandora&rsquo;s serendipitous song discovery. I turn to Rdio when I know I want to focus, but  feel uncertain about where my creative travels will take me. Rdio&rsquo;s full of music I think I might like, but I&rsquo;m not yet sure if I really want to make it part of my collection. When I&rsquo;m listening to Rdio, I&rsquo;m tinkering with ideas, seeing if I want to own them now or stow them away for later.</p>
<p>Music is important to my craft, even though it&rsquo;s not a touch point. I bought almost twice as much music in 2010 as I did in 2009. I started paying for both Rdio and Pandora. Text editors (I spent significant time in three of them last year), notebooks (I finished two and started a third), and various arcane tools are important to my work making code, organizing ideas, and shipping useful software. Getting my music right is perhaps just as crucial.</p>

<p>I have a somewhat irrational &ldquo;thing&rdquo; for Amazon Prime. So much so that I&rsquo;m a little surprised that I have such an affinity for what is in some ways simply the act of prepaying for shipping. But that&rsquo;s understating what Amazon Prime is.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prime is a fine example of physical computing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I click a button on my computer. Electrons fly all over the place. Database records are created, messages are sent. Pedestrian. But at some point a TV comes off a shelf and is loaded on a truck. Less than forty-eight hours later, it appears on my porch. Maybe not as nifty as an Arduino robot that mixes drinks, but just as physical and slightly more practical.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prime is what Amazon should have patented<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (if they could have waited). &ldquo;Method for buying something with one click&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t so impressive sounding. &ldquo;Method for integrating e-commerce, logistics, and shipping systems so that things magically appear at my house at my whimsy&rdquo;, now that&rsquo;s a good title for a patent.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazon Prime has a transformative effect on how I consume<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There are all sorts of things that I just kind of languish without because I never remember to buy them when I&rsquo;m at the right store. If it&rsquo;s not food, I buy it on Amazon now.</p>
<p>Today I decided I should buy more undershirts. Five minutes later, they&rsquo;re on their way to my house. Because I&rsquo;m paying a fixed rate for shipping every year, I don&rsquo;t worry about batching up my shopping. I just go buy things when I realize I need them. Potentially costly, yes. But now I&rsquo;ll have a proper supply of undershirts.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prime, coupled with Amazon&rsquo;s recommendations, is eerily effective<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Years and years ago, when I started using Amazon, the first thing I added to my wish list was first three seasons of Bosom Buddies on VHS (yes, that long ago). Amazon promptly recommend I look into other movies feature men dressed as women (good call, I find this amusing) and serious movies with Tom Hanks (not  as amusing).
Fast forward ten years, and Amazon gives me humorous, but much more useful, recommendations. I bought three things I&rsquo;d been meaning to pick up but had forgotten about due to recommendations. I&rsquo;m a little surprised the streak ended at three. I&rsquo;m sure there are legions lazy people like myself improving those recommendations right this moment.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Prime makes all sorts of transactions much more fluid for me. I spend less time in shopping centers and have a pretty great choice of products; in exchange, money departs my bank account more fluidly. When economists talk of the incredible complexity of markets, free market acolytes proclaim that truly free markets can route around inefficiences, and globalizationists trumpet the benefits of low-friction trade, they&rsquo;re talking about Amazon Prime. It&rsquo;s a service that could only exist in our current age of networks, connectedness, and impatience.</p>

			 <p>Into every creator&rsquo;s life, a few non-creative events must fall. Sometimes its meetings, maybe it&rsquo;s a bunch of business-related emails, or a bunch of support tasks have piled up and it comes time to empty the queue. Whatever the cause, the result is often the same: my day is robbed of chunks of time that are sufficient for tackling the code I wanted to work on. Total Groove Failure.</p>
<p>Going with the assumption that eliminating Total Groove Failure and its causes is impractical, I&rsquo;m left with the question of how to recover from these sorts of days. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I asked about this the other day<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I got two sorts of responses.</p>
<p>On the one hand, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you can withdraw<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Get away from the computer, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->maybe get some sleep<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->enjoy an adult beverage<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. One the other hand, you can take action. Get outside, go for a walk or exercise. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe work on a side project<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Start some code and leave it for the next morning to finish<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. These are some of my Groove Reacquisition Tools.</p>
<p>Discovering a new Groove Reacquisition Tool is a wonderful thing. None of them are silver bullets, but each one is little slice of confidence that, even if I get derailed, I can get back on the productivity train.</p>
<p>Whether through action or inaction, it&rsquo;s important to get away from the computer and/or that which sliced your day into fragments. From there, I&rsquo;ve often found it helpful to consider what it is that&rsquo;s stealing my focus and react appropriately. Some days I know that diving into some open source work will do the trick. Others, I need a nap, to exercise, or to wrap myself in a book.</p>
<p>The crucial bit is to realize I&rsquo;ve lost my groove. Not every interruption leads to Total Groove Failure. There are days where I respond to a few emails in the morning and quickly get into my coding happy place. But if I find myself frustrated at every turn, I resort to one of my Groove Reacquisition Tools.</p>

			 <p>For the past year, the Java ecosystem has seen interesting evolution. Java the language continues take its place as the new safety scissors of programming, but the pieces around it are getting better. The JVM is now acknowledged inside and outside of the Java community as really good stuff. Really interesting software like Hadoop and Cassandra are built on top of Java. Integration with languages like Ruby and Python is getting pretty good.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s most interesting to me is that there&rsquo;s a competition going on for the hearts and minds of those developers who don&rsquo;t like using safety scissors. This competition is a great experiment into what developers really want in a programming language. For a language nerd such as myself, observing this experiment is a lot of fun.</p>
<p>On one side you&rsquo;ve got Scala. Scala <!-- raw HTML omitted -->looks <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a lot like Java. But on top of that it adds shorthands and pleasantries from Ruby, a really good type system reminiscent of Haskell, and other handy functional features. When you build up a hybrid language like this you, two things happen. First, a lot of people who look at their checklist, find everything they need and decide. Second, you get a pretty complex language.</p>
<p>Clojure, however, looks nothing like Java. It&rsquo;s a Lisp, it simply can&rsquo;t. Clojure borrows from Haskell too, this time borrowing ideas about state and how to avoid it and concurrency (notably software transactional memory). Clojure is a funny looking language at first, but there are some great ideas within it. Plus, it&rsquo;s a relatively small language; it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s a different kind of simple and almost <!-- raw HTML omitted -->every<!-- raw HTML omitted --> concept is new to many developers.</p>
<p>Both these languages are building up strong communities. Both are full of great people with energy and ideas. It&rsquo;s quite possible that a winner-take-all situation won&rsquo;t occur. I&rsquo;d like that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s most interesting to me is to see how people take to the languages. Will they go for the familiarity of Scala and deal with the complexity? Will they learn the simplicities of Clojure and rewire their brains? Will they prove the common wisdom wrong and learn both?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watching with great interest.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m a Unix guy, by upbringing. My first formative experiences in software development were on an early, Linux 1.x version of Debian. I&rsquo;d used Windows, but always came back to Linux. When OS X got good enough around 10.2, I switched to something that didn&rsquo;t require so much tinkering, so I could make more useful stuff.</p>
<p>Software development on Unix has skewed towards focusing on tools, languages, and text editors for quite some time. IDEs and browsers on Unix are a messy, foreign thing (just like everything else in Unix). Thus, I&rsquo;ve long favored the terminal-and-editor style of development.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that now is the time for me to try something different. I like text editors and directly manipulating text, but I can see why some people feel naked without an IDE. The ability to pop-up a level and make a more broad-stroked transformation to a program is appealing. Having code navigation and semantic awareness baked in has lots of potential.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve probably said grumbly things about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RubyMine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the past, but I think now is the time to give it a go. Worst thing that could happen is that I don&rsquo;t like it and I go back to the infinite tinkering of Emacs or the 85% perfect experience of TextMate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I originally wrote that a few months ago, at the apex of my editor neurosis.</p>
<p>I did give RubyMine a try, and I like some parts of it. It&rsquo;s code navigation is pretty nice, it does an admirable job of integrating with the unique ecosystem of tools that a Ruby developer uses to manage their environment, and it does an excellent job of grokking TDD with test/unit and RSpec. RubyMine is a step in the right direction. I suspect that if I had muscle memory for IntelliJ, it would be the way to go.</p>
<p>But, I have muscle memory for TextMate and Emacs, and I have an affinity for being close to my tools. RubyMine felt one step disconnected from both my muscle memory and my tools. That&rsquo;s quite an accomplishment; most IDEs feel several steps removed the tools and seem to discourage developing finger-memory in favor of menu-memory. I&rsquo;ll give RubyMine another try in a year, probably, see how it&rsquo;s coming along. But in the mean time, it&rsquo;s great to see that there is a vendor out there tackling the challenge that is tools for Ruby.</p>

			 <p>Elevator pitch: I&rsquo;ve found that if you want to divert a productive team into an hour or two of semi-fruitless banter, ask how the team should use Git, Pivotal Tracker, and Capistrano to manage incoming work, verify it, and deploy it to production. In reality, you should ignore all the corner-cases and figure out what will enable you to push really small chunks of work with great frequency.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ed. What follows isn&rsquo;t novel, but it was a useful change in perspective for me, so I decided to share.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a bit about software processes lately. Despite great variation in telling you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to do so, most processes seem to focus on to do more stuff faster.</p>
<p>Lately, the notion of doing less has a lot of interest. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lean startups<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are the new-new thing and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Real<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the old new thing; both preach getting more done and delivering value by doing less and analyzing the results more.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of &ldquo;do less&rdquo; a software developer can engage in. In the past I&rsquo;ve been a little too focused on how I can take on fewer responsibilities from other parties. Literally doing less by scoping down features, putting off decisions, and focusing on things that seem like they really matter. I sometimes feel like I&rsquo;ve become too eager to do less, making myself something of a cranky coder/slacker. But I digress</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been trying to tackle doing less in my habits of creating software. How can I write less code to implement a feature, not in the minimalist sense, but in the &ldquo;how do I just get it to kinda work sense&rdquo;? How can I take less time between starting something and getting some form of it out in the wild? How can I make my code less coupled so there are fewer changes to make when I decide it needs to do something else? How can I make this less coupled to data storage so that putting it out requires less deployment effort? How can I make changes that are less likely to cause long-term regressions? How can I make it less effort to rollback bad changes?</p>
<p>When I look through the lens of accomplishing more by doing less, a lot of popular software methodology seems like dead weight. Rather than trying to find a process that addresses every team member&rsquo;s own scars and affections, both perceived and imaginary, it seems most useful to imagine the smallest ruleset that won&rsquo;t result in uncontrollable entropy and put it into action. If something starts to hurt, imagine the simplest new rule and put it into play.</p>
<p>The goal, as stated above, is to get to the point where you make really tiny, maybe imperceptible changes, and push them really frequently. Everything that stands in the way is the enemy.</p>

			 <p>Of all the new and reimagined code in Rails 3, ActiveModel and ActiveRelation rank amongst what I find the most interesting. I&rsquo;m excited that they potentially lower the bar to implementing one&rsquo;s own data layer. If you&rsquo;ve got some custom backend or datastore, writing a nice API around it has previously been quite the endeavor. To get it working is one thing; to make it as pleasant to use for application programmers is another thing entirely. ActiveModel and ActiveRelation have been extracted from ActiveRecord and make the task of building one&rsquo;s own model layer far easier.</p>
<p>My presentation for RailsConf 2010 focused on what ActiveModel and ActiveRelation provide and how one can use it to write cleaner code in domain models, how to make your models feel more like ActiveRecord objects, and how to use ActiveRelation to build your own persistence layers.</p>
<p>I hope you find the slides educational. Further, I&rsquo;ve posted the examples on GitHub so you can play along at home. If you&rsquo;re particularly interested in ActiveRelation, I hope you&rsquo;ll <!-- raw HTML omitted -->find the examples useful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a starting point to using that library.</p>

			 <p>Over the past year, I&rsquo;ve been trying to create more stuff, some of which I&rsquo;d hope to turn out awesome. Largely this is an ongoing sort of thing. I try things, I learn a little, I keep at it. Some things I try work, others don&rsquo;t. I try to make a habit out of the things that have worked out well. I make a note of things that seem to help me get out of a funk when I&rsquo;m not making as much as I&rsquo;d like or having trouble putting in the hours I think are necessary to make cool stuff.</p>
<p>I first distilled these ideas into a talk I did at RubyConf 2009 on having more fun while coding. But I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time; I was just sharing some ideas about how to have fun. For me, one of the ways to have more fun is to make more time to have fun. But that&rsquo;s just the beginning of making more awesome. I found I had to make more time, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> develop a bunch of other habits.</p>
<p>For Big Design 2010, I honed the ideas, habits, and tricks I&rsquo;ve found useful to me into a presentation on how to get off the couch, start making more things, and make some of those things awesome. I hope you&rsquo;ll find it useful and perhaps start making lots of awesome stuff.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In the past couple of years, I’ve discovered an interesting way to think about programming problems. I try to solve them while I’m away from the computer. Talking through a program, trying to hold all the abstractions in my head, thinking about ways to re-arrange the code to solve the problem at hand whilst walking. The key to this is that I’m activating different parts of my brain to try and solve the problem. We literally think differently when we talk than when we write or type. Sometimes, the notion you need is locked up in other parts of your brain, just waiting for you to activate them.[1]</p>
<p>But sometimes, when I’m doing this thinking, there is something I really miss: the feel of the keyboard under my fingers and the staccato of typing. If there’s an analog to “I love the smell of napalm in the morning”, it’s “I love the sound of spring-loaded keys making codes”.</p>
<p>With the release of the iPad, it’s quite likely that a large percentage of the population can start to eschew the traditional keyboard and pointer that have served them in such a mediocre fashion for so long. On the other hand, you can take my keyboard from my cold dead hands. I really like typing, I’m pretty good at it, and I feel like I get a lot done, pretty quickly, when I’m typing.</p>
<p>Last year, I decided I would give other text editors a try. I stepped out from my TextMate happy place to try <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VIM<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I knew this part of the experiment wasn’t going to work because when I felt like I’d gone through enough reading, tutorials and re-learning of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VIM<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I sat down to tap out some code. And…nothing. I felt like I was operating the editor instead of letting the code flow from my brain, through my fingertips, onto the display. It was as if I had to operate through a secondary device in order to produce code.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems that developers think with their fingers. I’m not sure what the future of that is. We’ve created environments for programming that are highly optimized for using ten fingers nearly simultaneously. How will that translate to new devices that focus on direct manipulation with at most two or three fingers at a time. Will new input mechanisms like orientation and acceleration take up the slack?</p>
<p>Will we finally let go off the editor-compiler-runtime triumvirate? Attempts to get us out of this rut in the past have proven to be folly. I’m hoping this time around the externalities at the root of past false starts are identified and the useful essence is extracted into something really compelling.</p>
<p>In the mean time, it’s going to be fun trying the different ways to code on an iPad as designers and developers try new ways to make machines do our bidding.</p>

			 <p>Some of the most villified companies are poorly regarded because of the way they treat their own customers. Think about people complaining about AT&amp;T&rsquo;s service in New York City or people put on hold for hours by their electric company during a power disruption. Instead of treating these problems as real, telephone and electrical companies treat them as items in a queue to be dealt with as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>And thus, systems are set up that put a premium on throughput. Rewards are given to those who prevent customers from taking the time of the real experts who might fix a problem. Glib voice menus serve as a layer of indirection before you even reach a human. Service disruptions often bear a message tantamount to saying &ldquo;we know we are not giving you the service we promised, buzz off and wait until we manage to fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite all this, sometimes you come upon a real jewel. Someone who really helps you, who cares about what&rsquo;s going on. That special person who doesn&rsquo;t care so much about their average call time, but who takes the time to get <em>you</em> to a happy place.</p>
<p>These are good actors working within a rotten system;  kindly cogs in a vicious machine. I could call up AT&amp;T and talk to any number of nice, well-meaning and empathetic people. Sometimes they are empowered and can fix the problem I face. Just as frequently, they want to help but the system they operate in prevents them from doing so, either because it would take too much time or because it is deemed too expensive to put the decision in the hands of those answering the phones.</p>
<p>When I describe them as cogs, it&rsquo;s almost literal. Though manufacturing in the US is in serious decline, manufacturing-style management is not. Managers routinely and without irony describe people they might hire as &ldquo;resources&rdquo; that they can &ldquo;utilize&rdquo;. If there were a machine that could pop out customers whose problems had been resolved, managers would &ldquo;utilize&rdquo; those &ldquo;resources&rdquo; in the same way. Indeed, the majority of information systems attempt to do just this.</p>
<p>My point is that we regard a company like AT&amp;T, Microsoft, Walmart, or Coca-Cola as a homogenous thing with its own will, priorities, and personality. But companies aren&rsquo;t homogenous, because people aren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The applications I observe fellow creators using to create often don&rsquo;t fit into their environment. They don&rsquo;t fit into the native look-and-feel. They ignore important idioms. Their metaphors are imperfect, the conceptual edges left unfinished.</p>
<p>In part I notice this because as creators we tend to live in a few different applications, and time reveals most shortcomings. But in part, I notice this because the applications are in fact flawed. Flawed to the point, that you would think given my opening words, that I would refuse to use them. And indeed, I refuse to use many of the applications that others find completely acceptable for making the same kinds of things I do.</p>
<p>Increasingly, it seems the applications that people who create things live in offer a disjoint user experience. I&rsquo;m thinking of visual people living in Photoshop or Illustrator or developers living in Emacs or Terminal.app. We use these applications because they best allow us to make what we want and get in our way only a little bit. But, it&rsquo;s a tenuous relationship at best.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this say about what we&rsquo;re doing and the boundaries that we operate along? Would we accept the same kinds of shortcomings in say, a calendar application or a clock widget, if those were central to our workflow? That is, is there something about the creative process that leads us to accept sub-perfect tools? Is it inevitable that someone seeking to make new things will find their tools imperfect? Is the quest for ever-more perfect tools part of how we grow as makers?</p>
<p>I hate closing with a bunch of questions, but this piece is but an imperfect tool for discovering an idea.</p>

			 <p>Embedded within the migraine that is American politics are some very interesting ideas. Economics, markets, ethics, freedom, equality, education, transportation, and security are all intriguing topics. Recently, I figured out that the headache comes not from people or trying to make the ideas work, but in politics. Getting a majority of the people to agree on anything is a giant pain of coordination. When you throw in fearmongering, power struggles, critically wounded media, and the fact most people would rather not think deeply about any of this you end up with the major downer that we face today.</p>
<p>All that said, here are some pithy one-liners about politics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If I were part of the Democratic leadership, I&rsquo;d be wondering how you take the high road in a race to the bottom. And win.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I were a Republican, I&rsquo;d be wondering how to dig myself out of this giant hole I made by winning a race to the bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I were a libertarian, I&rsquo;d be wondering how to convince people that the Tea Party is different from what I believe in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I were a leader of the Tea Party, I&rsquo;d be wondering what I&rsquo;m going to do when someone who claims to be a part of the Tea Party blows up a building or goes nuts with an assault rifle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I were a politician, I&rsquo;d wonder how much I have to compromise my values and what I really wanted to accomplish but still get enough votes to keep my job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I were skeptical of climate change due to human activity, I&rsquo;d be wondering how I&rsquo;m going to find a spaceship, because this line of reasoning leads to the conclusion that the Earth is about to become very inhospitable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I were a nihilist, I&rsquo;d wonder&hellip;nothing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There, have I offended everyone?</p>

			 <p>Last March my wife and I joined a gym, started working out with a trainer, started trying to eat better, and set out to improve our health. Amazingly, we&rsquo;ve stuck with it (after two previous failed attempts in years past) and are both in much better shape than we&rsquo;ve been in for quite some time.</p>
<p>One of my personal reasons for doing this was what I&rsquo;d been hearing about the correlation between working out, eating better, and brain function. Lots of people who read way more into this than I do had been saying that if you eat better and exercise more, your brain will work better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this first hand. The day after my first serious run, my mind was in overdrive. I had lots of great ideas, I worked through them quickly, and I didn&rsquo;t procrastinate when it came to exploring or realizing them.</p>
<p>Today, I had the opposite experience. I went out for a rather large Tex-Mex lunch. Lots of starch. I got home and took a nap, as is often my wont. Usually I wake up ready to get back to work after my naps. But today was different. My brain was thoroughly sluggish. My body&rsquo;s energy was going towards digestion, not thought.</p>
<p>I guess this is something of a break-up letter for me. You see, I&rsquo;ve long enjoyed the large, starchy lunch. But, I&rsquo;m not sure I can put up with it anymore. If its a choice between starchy, tasty lunches and a high-functioning brain, I&rsquo;m going to have to choose my brain.</p>
<p>Sorry, lunch-time gutbombs. We had a good run, but I&rsquo;m going to have to quit you for a while.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Time is the New Memory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how we represent time in programs for a while. The problem is that concurrent programs are all about time, but mostly, we only use two mechanisms to represent it in our programs.</p>
<p>The semi-explicit way is through locks. When we insert locks around some bit of code, we are giving hints to the system that things should only proceed in a certain order. This ordering gives us a notion of time, but it&rsquo;s not horribly comforting.</p>
<p>The completely implicit way we represent time in our programs is by ordering calls to functions and the lines of code within those functions. Line 10 <em>always</em> executes before line 11, etc.</p>
<p>The problem that Rich Hickey, who has some fantastic ideas about this time stuff, has in the article I quoted is that time is managed manually and implicitly. When you start writing large concurrent programs, this falls apart. We need better constructs to deal with it.</p>
<p>Think of it like the shift from unstructured programming to structured programming to object-oriented programming. At first we just had a long code listing; no functions, just line after line of code. This became mentally untenable, so we shifted to structured, procedural programming. But some of our data was global and it was often hard to tell what functions belong to what data. So we moved to object-oriented programming and encapsulation.</p>
<p>Hopefully Rich Hickey, Simon Peyton-Jones and other functional programming folks can lead us to is a nice way to structure our programs around time. I&rsquo;m eager to have my brain melted by what they conjure up.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why I do Time Tracking<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>At one point, I tracked every context switch during my work day. I kept a legal pad next to my mouse and I would write down the time whenever I switched between coding, emailing, surfing, talking to someone in my cube or walking around to find someone I needed to talk to.</p>
<p>People thought I was odd. They&rsquo;d ask what I was jotting down when I noted my context switch, so I briefly explained it. &ldquo;Okaaaayyyyyy?&rdquo;, they&rsquo;d say. An unintended side-effect was that people did end up bugging me about random things less. In fact, it was way more effective at that than putting up a sign that said &ldquo;unless something is on fire, email me&rdquo;. So it goes.</p>
<p>I never ended up running any aggregate numbers on the data. But, it did give me an idea about the frequency and cost of my context switches. I wish there was a better way to track this sort of thing passively. I&rsquo;m sure it would still shock me how much time I go in and out of focus.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never tried this sort of experiment, it&rsquo;s worth running for a week or two. You&rsquo;ll almost certainly notice something worth trying to cut out by glancing over the list of things you&rsquo;re spending time or wasting focus on.</p>

			 <p>Almost five years ago, we were witness to the reinvention of web frameworks. A couple upstarts named Django and Rails appeared at almost the same time, espousing many of the same values. In the typical Gandhi-cycle, they were first ignored, the incumbents fought them, and then they achieved victory over the incumbents. Today, any framework that&rsquo;s used on new projects is likely to have more than a hint of Django and Rails in it.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re seeing the same thing for databases. Something is going on and things are changing. Barring an unprecedented departure of fashion from software development, I&rsquo;ll look back five years from now and write about some other shift in the development landscape.</p>
<p>But, all shifts like this need a name. Right now, the best we have is NoSQL. The problem with that name is that it only defines what it is not. That makes it confrontational and not amazingly particular to what it includes or excludes.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Damien Katz<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the creator of CouchDB, has noted <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the need for a better name for this storage revolution<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Allow me to proffer mine:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Post-relational<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re seeing its the end of the assumption that valuable data should go in some kind of relational database. The end of the assumption that SQL and ACID are the only tools for solving our problems. The end of the viability of master/slave scaling. The end of weaving the relational model through our application code.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing an explosion in the ideas about how one should store important data. We&rsquo;re looking at data to see if it&rsquo;s even worth persisting. We&rsquo;re experimenting with new semantics around structure, consistency and concurrency.</p>
<p>In the same way that post-modernism is about reconsidering the ways of the past in art and architecture, post-relational is a chance for software developers to reconsider our own ways. Just as post-modernism didn&rsquo;t invalidate the entire history of art, post-relational won&rsquo;t invalidate the usefulness of relational databases.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s likely that those working in some domains will decide that non-relational databases better fit their needs. That&rsquo;s progress in our field. It&rsquo;s fun to watch.</p>
<p>Say it with me: post-relational databases, post-relational storage, post-relational thinking, or simply, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post-relational<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>I promised you the details on how we built <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tag Better<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so here we go. This is what I used to build the back-end bits. You&rsquo;ll have to pester <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chris<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alex<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get the front-end details.</p>
<p>h2. Sinatra</p>
<p>Technically, it&rsquo;s a Rails Rumble. Read between the lines of the rules and you&rsquo;ll see it&rsquo;s really a <em>Rack</em> Rumble. And so I went with my favorite for prototyping, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sinatra<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Happily, Sinatra had my back the whole time. I never came across anything that stumped me. Further, I didn&rsquo;t pay any taxes for ceremony I don&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Verdict<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: perfect tool for the job.</p>
<p>h2. Passenger</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Passenger<!-- raw HTML omitted --> much before this weekend. I&rsquo;m pretty happy spooling up app processes in a terminal and watching the logs scroll past. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->localhost:3000<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is my friend.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m an outlier in this regard. My teammates aren&rsquo;t as interested in lower-level bits as I am, so I figured that using Passenger is the best bet to help them get the app up and running locally.</p>
<p>The benefit that I didn&rsquo;t realize we&rsquo;d get from this is running the same stack locally as on the production server. Besides some virtual host wrangling that Passenger Pane saved me from locally, getting the app up and running was painless.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Verdict<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I am quite likely to keep tolerate Apache for that Passenger goodness, especially when I am the operations guy.</p>
<p>h2. Sprinkle + passenger_stack</p>
<p>The moment that I realized we&rsquo;d have to set up our own server instance was one of brief, abject terror. I knew this could easily expand to fill <em>a lot</em> more of my time than I wanted. Luckily, I was wrong.</p>
<p>Ben Schwartz&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->passenger_stack<!-- raw HTML omitted --> helped me get our Linode slice up far faster than I would have been able to by hand. I cloned his repo, tweaked it to our needs (disabled MySQL, eventually added a CouchDB recipe) and ran it on our server. Several minutes later, we had a working server. Pretty awesome.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->passenger_stack<!-- raw HTML omitted --> uses <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sprinkle<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which isn&rsquo;t getting as much play in the server configuration space as Puppet and Chef. Sprinkle does seem really well suited to standing up apps on a few servers. We might want to step up to something heftier once we had more servers, but Sprinkle and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->passenger_stack<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are simple to understand and don&rsquo;t require any supporting infrastructure to use.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Verdict<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Not too primitive, not too involved; just right.</p>
<p>h2. CouchDB</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m building any app that relies on an API as its primary data source, caching API response data is forefront on my mind. Serving the data locally, rather than making a request every time, means the app feels more responsive. An added benefit is not upsetting the upstream data provider.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve built apps like this that use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MySQL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a cache and it just never felt right. I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CouchDB<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tokyo Cabinet/Tyrant<!-- raw HTML omitted --> lately. I decided to go with CouchDB for this one because of the excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CouchDBX<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which makes it easier for those who don&rsquo;t even know what Erlang is to use CouchDB.</p>
<p>CouchDB ended up working pretty well. While we haven&rsquo;t really leaned into it, it didn&rsquo;t present any challenges while I was developing. Using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CouchRest<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with Sinatra worked just fine.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Verdict<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: It just worked, which is exactly what I needed.</p>
<p>h2. Skipping traditional TDD</p>
<p>OK, so maybe only Jared Diamond would consider this a technology. But skipping the writing of tests to drive my design was pretty helpful. Consider <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kent Beck&rsquo;s flight metaphor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Doing a Rails Rumble is just like the taxi-ing phase. Or a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->minimum valuable product<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Either way, you want to make a small investment towards validating an idea.</p>
<p>Notice I said <em>traditional</em> TDD. To tell the truth, I did write a sniff test script after I had the basic app working. But it wasn&rsquo;t an xUnit-style test. It&rsquo;s just a shell script that bangs on the app with fixed parameters. I do have to manually inspect it to make sure nothing is blowing up. What I&rsquo;m really automating here is the pain of typing out Curl commands.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Verdict<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: worked great for the original purposes, but I&rsquo;ll probably add a proper test suite as one of the first post-contest enhancements</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I think helped make our project go off pretty well. Really, what they did was <em>help me get stuff done and then get out of the way</em>. Isn&rsquo;t that the best kind of tool?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday and today, I worked with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alex Bischoff<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chris Griego<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rails Rumble<!-- raw HTML omitted --> project. In less than forty-eight hours, we set out to build a web application, using Ruby, from the ground up. While we didn&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->boil the ocean<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we did come up with something interesting.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tag Better<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the groundwork for an app that enhances one of our favorite, but often neglected, sites: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->del.icio.us<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Personally, I&rsquo;ve tried other bookmarking tools such as a plain text file, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EagleFiler<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pinboard.in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (which I think has an excellent chance of eclipsing Delicious). However, I&rsquo;ve found myself back on Delicious, even after a hiatus.</p>
<p>Given Yahoo&rsquo;s unsteady stewardship of the site, we figured it&rsquo;s time to take matters in our own hands. Using their API, it&rsquo;s entirely possible for us to build enhancements on top of Delicious. We decided to do just that.</p>
<p>h2. Triage and tidying</p>
<p>We started out from a gem of an idea that Chris had. When you&rsquo;re trying to better organize your tags and bundles in Delicious, there are two modes you might want to operate under. The first couple times, you need to do triage. Get stuff roughly into order, and start creating a filing system. Once you&rsquo;ve got everything under control, you switch to tidying. Now you just need to keep things clean or maybe switch things around that aren&rsquo;t working well.</p>
<p>We tackled triage first. In specific, we wanted a way to filter down our list of tags, select a bundle, and add some of the filtered tags to that bundle.</p>
<p>h2. Try it out</p>
<p>To get started with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tag Better<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you&rsquo;ll first need to log in with your Delicious username and password (more on that in a moment.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once you&rsquo;re logged in, you&rsquo;ll see your tag bundles on the left and all your tags on the right. If you click a bundle, the tags that are included in that bundle are highlighted. Clicking a tag toggles its inclusion in the bundle. Changes in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tag Better<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are immediately reflected in Delicious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the core interaction. You can also logout, of course. And, if you feel the need, we offer a way to remove your bundle and tag data from our system&rsquo;s caches.</p>
<p>We were just four short characters away from getting live filtering of your tags via the search box on the top right. Alex and I even got it working, but keyboard cat had already played us out at that point. I promise we&rsquo;ll add it as soon as judging is over!</p>
<p>A couple other caveats: you might want to create a test bundle (in the Delicious UI) to play with, rather than one you&rsquo;ve already organized. I don&rsquo;t think there are problems in the code, but it never hurt to show caution. Also, IE support is probably &ldquo;interesting&rdquo;, at this point.</p>
<p>h2. Trust</p>
<p>Even though we need your Delicious username and password to edit bundles on your behalf, we have made sure to never store authentication information on our side. Your authentication data is stored in a cookie on your machine; if you don&rsquo;t like that, you should probably skip out on using Tag Better as a hosted app. If you delete that cookie, we won&rsquo;t operate on your data. Further, we&rsquo;ve added the ability for you to remove your bundle and tag data from our system. That&rsquo;s the only data that we save on our disks.</p>
<p>I mentioned trust and your authentication data earlier. It&rsquo;s an important part of an application like this. We don&rsquo;t want to screw your bookmarks up, and you don&rsquo;t want us to do skeezy things with your bookmarks. Unfortunately, Delicious does not yet offer a delegated authentication API like Flickr and Twitter do. So, we&rsquo;ve got two options.</p>
<p>On the one hand, you could trust us. This is up to you. I&rsquo;d like to think that if you&rsquo;ve met Alex, Chris or I, then you&rsquo;re happy to use the application knowing we&rsquo;ve got more amusing things to do than soil your bookmarks. Further, when the competition is over, we&rsquo;ll open the source repository up to the public. If you&rsquo;re a code-review sort of person, go nuts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you could run it yourself. Again, once the competition is over, we&rsquo;re going to release the code. Look over the readme, install the dependencies, and run it on your own hardware. Sleep safely at night knowing your password is safely ensconced on your personal machine.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll talk a bit about the technology we used to make <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tag Better<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Until then, I hope you&rsquo;ll give it a try. If you have ideas for feedback, leave a comment here!</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I met Why The Lucky Stiff for the first time at SXSW 2006. By some odd cosmic occurrence, he was performing during the Interactive schedule. I&rsquo;m not sure the programming committee realized it would be a <em>performance</em> and not a panel. But there they were. All new material. Attempted audience interaction, subterfuged by the shoddy conference WiFi[1]. It was great.</p>
<p>After The Thirsty Cups performed, I introduced myself. &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Adam, glad to meet you&rdquo;, etc. Then I came with my wildcard. Until I&rsquo;d met him and shook his hand, I&rsquo;d harbored a theory that Why was really an A-List celebrity, probably one from <em>Ocean&rsquo;s 11</em>, that was using an alter-ego identity to share his love of Ruby. He suggested that I was, in fact, Brad Pitt. Which may be true. But I like to think that he enjoyed my theory.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of my life-long pleasures has been making people laugh. Along those lines, a high watermark in that endeavor was when Why posted my zany Star Trek/Ruby sketch to Red Handed. I felt I had arrived; he praised my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Picard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> impersonation!</p>
<p>Life is good.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;d somewhat forgotten this, but a lack of seriousness, in the &ldquo;I write weighty code, you should take me seriously&rdquo; sort of way, is my best guess as to what Why&rsquo;s schtick is. Lots of people have made a big deal about how unprofessional it is for him to just yank his code off the net, or about how his code was messy, stuff like this. They&rsquo;re missing the point. I think Why just wanted to have fun, with code, and spread the fun, with code.</p>
<p>To an extent we, the community of developers who care about code and software, have forgotten how to have fun with what we do. Personally, I&rsquo;m going to get right back on that.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->More: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rick Olson<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sent me <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a picture from SXSW 2006<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Damon Clinkscales<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sent along <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->videos<!-- raw HTML omitted --> he took of the performance.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The trick about good art is that it has some mystery, an unknown. The problem is that if you get too close to the art, you risk unraveling the mystery. If you deconstruct it, engage it, or study it, the unknown becomes known. Thus, if I really enjoy a song (in particular), movie, etc. I stay away from taking it apart to see how it works. I&rsquo;d rather enjoy it for a long time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have this problem where I over-listen to an album. It started in my teenage years. I learned all the bass-lines for Pearl Jam&rsquo;s <em>Ten</em>. After that, I couldn&rsquo;t listen to the album for ten years; I knew all the secrets, all the interesting bits. Rewind a year ago, and The Who&rsquo;s <em>Live At Leeds</em> was my jam. Now, I can&rsquo;t listen to it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been very rigorous about listening to Bruce Springteen&rsquo;s <em>Born To Run</em>. It is such a perfect piece that I only allow myself to listen to it once a month[1]. No more. Similarly, I won&rsquo;t let myself learn to play any of the songs on the guitar. I want to maintain that mystery.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I wonder if there is other art like this. Could you get overexposed to a Mondrian painting or a Hemingway book? Even with works that are more popular in their sensibilities, is it possible? Is there such a thing as too much <em>Starry Night</em> or <em>Ghostbusters</em>?[2]</p>
<p>The bottom line: enjoy good art, but take care not to over-enjoy it.</p>
<p>fn1. I even feel like I&rsquo;m cheating if I listen to Born To Run in anything but album-form. To hear &ldquo;Thunder Road&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jungleland&rdquo; by itself feels incomplete, like I&rsquo;m missing something.</p>
<p>fn2. Yes, I just put these on the same level, even though I&rsquo;m not much of a van Gogh aficionado.</p>

			 <p>I have extremely mixed feelings about code re-use. I think it&rsquo;s largely a red herring, never working out as well as developers would hope. After all, developers are like golfers; always optimistic about how well an approach will
work or how far down the fairway their ball landed.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s a real stab in the side of code re-use: in many cases, it&rsquo;s tantamount to technical debt. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Embrace technical debt<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Using someone else&rsquo;s code will help you keep moving now, but you stand a good chance of needing to rewrite it later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s all bad. By the time you know you need to replace someone else&rsquo;s code, you&rsquo;ll have learned about the domain it covers and how you need to solve that problem in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->your<!-- raw HTML omitted --> domain.</p>
<p>Keep it in mind: just because you can drop someone else&rsquo;s code into your app and use it, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s all roses and butterscotch.</p>

<p>When the accompanying <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> app came out, I fell in love again. Instapaper is perfect for filling your interstitial time, which is something I often find myself when I fish my iPhone out of my pocket.

<p>The love affair grew stronger recently. The newest version of the iPhone app came out boasting great improvements to the interaction design and new functionality that makes it an even better tool for occupying the time where you would otherwise find yourself day-dreaming[1].</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Firstly: a sort of light-weight feed reading mechanism. It’s not for every site out there; there’s a curated list of sites you can consume in this way. I went with The Economist, but noticed things like Wikipedia Featured, Wired, The New Yorker, and popular stories posted to Instapaper. Great idea.</p>
<p>Next: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->folders<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I’ve used it to organize my reading list into topics so that I can quickly go to whatever matches my mood or energy level. This functionality is present in the web app too, and Marco’s done a great job of making it really easy to set things up just the way you want.</p>
<p>Finally: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shared favorites<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Peek into what other people have marked as great reading. Maybe it’s a cliche “social feature”, but I’m excited to see curated reading lists from my wonderful friends.</p>
<p>In conclusion: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Marco Ament<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is awesome, start using Instapaper and leave your username in the comments so I can read your stuff.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I believe that writing code using testing[1] as a design activity yields long-term benefits that make my life easier.</p>
<p>Though I’m a strong believer, I’ve struggled with TDD in the past. I’ve found I get bogged down in keeping the red-green-refactor cycle going. Sometimes I have to work with code that is lacking sufficient tests, but I know I can’t boil the ocean before I proceed to whatever I’m <em>really</em> trying to do with the code. Other times, I’m not sure if I’m testing the right things; I could be missing tests in one place and writing too many tests in another.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Last week, I read three insightful pieces and made one discovery of my own that deepened my understanding of the practice of TDD. Allow me to share.</p>
<p>First off, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kent Beck has been exploring the phases in the life of a startup<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The earliest stage is proving the idea. He later asserted that when you’re doing stuff like this, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you can drop TDD<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, temporarily. I thought about this and it clicked. If you’re working on a prototype, where you’re trying to explore an idea and see if it works, you don’t want to iterate on the code, as TDD would have you do. You want to iterate on the <em>idea</em>. TDD will just slow you down.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, you’ve got maintenance programming. Once a startup, company or project has proven their idea and shipped a system, you are maintaining software. Keeping it working, living, breathing. For this sort of development, where you’re making small, focused changes without adding significant functionality, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tim Bray pointed out that TDD is critical<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Using it to drive the process of fixing bugs, cleaning up the system and adding minor functionality is really handy for figuring out if you’ve broken something in some dark corner. It also helps the next guy to do the same. It’s a win, and I suspect it’s the sweet-spot of TDD.</p>
<p>If you imagine prototyping and maintenance as opposite ends of the software life-cycle spectrum, adding significant new features to existing software probably lies somewhere in the middle. You may need to “poke around” to decide if what you’re doing is right, like when you’re prototyping. But once you’re done, you want some way for others who have to maintain the software (such as yourself) to figure out what it’s supposed to do and whether assumptions have been broken.</p>
<p>Then I read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an anecdote by Uncle Bob about how he worked out an ambitious new feature in Fitnesse<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. He and his pair got a new feature working, celebrated, and called it a night. When he woke up, he realized they weren’t actually done; they still had to clean it up, by writing tests.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This was the missing link, for me. Sometimes, you need to iterate on the idea first. If skipping the tests helps you, so it goes. Once you’ve got the idea working (and committed!), then start writing tests[2]. Once you’re happy with the structure and coverage of your code, you commit again and <em>then</em> push it to your peers[3].</p>
<p>The crux of my revelation is this: you get the benefits of TDD-as-a-design-activity by doing it. <em>When</em> you do it is immaterial. You just <em>have</em> to do it.</p>
<p>My own revelation is blindingly obvious in retrospect. If the going gets tough, proceed in this order: get it to work, write some tests for it, <em>then</em> clean up the code. Sometimes you can break this cycle if what you’re working on doesn’t take too much cognitive capacity. But if you overflow your mental buffer, you have to break it down into steps and work through the cycle. Failing to realize this was one of the causes of me bogging down in TDD.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Adding context to answer the question of when you start writing tests is something I haven’t found much writing on until recently. I’m increasingly finding that considering the situation is a great ninja-move in my quest towards writing beautiful, useful code.</p>
<p>fn1. Call it a test, example, behavior, or story. Whatever.</p>
<p>fn2. Jim Weirich did a great presentation on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how to backfill tests on existing code<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>fn3. Pardon the Git-centric terminology[4].</p>
<p>fn4. If you are not already, please start using Git immediately.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;re just wrapping up that nice time of the year in Texas. Technically, we get two nice parts of the year: the one after &quot;winter&quot; and the one after <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SUMMER<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s nice in that you can sit outside with the dogs and just enjoy the air, the sounds and the fact you can sit idly without wishing you were in a climate-controlled environment.</p>
<p>This year I&rsquo;m actually taking advantage of this part of the year by golfing. All the public courses are blooming: the fairways are green, the bunkers are as sandy as they&rsquo;ll get and the greens are in peak condition.</p>
<p>My golf game is improving; a novel experience. I’m hitting some fairways, some greens and making the occasional nice putt. It’s like seeing an investment pay out. Hopefully I’ll finish the summer hitting under 100 on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Golf is nice, for me, because it’s as close as I get to meditation. I don&rsquo;t think about code, politics, or finance. I just think about the previous shot and the next shot. In fact, the less I think, the better I do. Golf is my chance to attempt nihlism.</p>
<p>Golf is relaxing. It’s a little vacation. I sometimes see guys out with their wives. They’re doing it wrong. The point of golf is to spend some time away from everything. By this definition, professionals like Tiger Woods are doing it wrong too. Maybe I’m on to something here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a moment in my game, somewhere on the last three holes, where I realize I’m going to have to go back to being responsible. This moment is like hitting a bad shot; you think you can do better. On the other hand, it takes a long time to play eighteen holes, so getting back to responsibility is a good thing.</p>
<p>What would I do if I didn’t play golf? I don&rsquo;t know. Golf, as lame as a lot of people think it is, does good things for my brain. Maybe that explains my obsession/addiction. Luckily, I’ve given up my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Call of Duty 4<!-- raw HTML omitted --> addition.

Is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fread<!-- raw HTML omitted --> thread-safe? “How should I know, I just learned C last semester and about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fread<!-- raw HTML omitted -->’s parameters last week!”</p>
<p>The promises of a modern relational database include a compelling bullet point: your data is safe with us. Use our APIs, don’t break the rules, and we will make sure you never blow away some data and get a call at 3 AM. Rather, the DBA will, but what do you care about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> guy?</p>
<p>So I submit to you that most programmers don’t use databases because they’re great. Rather, they have come to rely upon them because the canonical tome on transactions is heavy enough to maim small mammals and rife with formalisms. So they skip the nine-hundred page textbook and pick up the six-hundred page O’Reilly book.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Most programs that people will pay you to write involve side-effects. Further, many of those side-effects have to do with saving data off so you can perform further side-effects on it in the future.</p>
<p>The rookie developer typically leans first to files. Files are familiar and pervasive. But files leave a lot to said rookie. How should I structure my data? How do I load and save the data? How do I manipulate the data once it’s in memory? Even in scripting languages, with their simplified APIs, this means the rookie is faced with APIs like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When I was bit a wee lad o’ programming, I found this Gordian knot difficult to cut. But then, one day, I was told by a programmer of greater wisdom to use a database. That API looked like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was a lot easier to understand, even though the last four are a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->completely different language<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>So, I submit to you, that SQL also won because it was easier to understand how one might structure their programs, make them work and, if they’re lucky, get them to run quickly.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’d wager that five years from now, the generation of developers who are now upcoming won’t take the database tier for granted. Key-value stores, distributed file systems and document databases will all play into the question of “what do we do with the important data?” Sometimes, relational databases will prove useful. But increasingly, other things will too.</p>
<p>In the end, there’s two ways to look at this: we will soon throw down the shackles of our relational overlords, or, prepare yourself for the database renaissance in programming fashion that will occur in a decade or so.</p>
<p>Everyone wins!</p>

			 <p>I was thinking about the sorts of personal sites I&rsquo;ve enjoyed on the web. They roughly fall into two sorts, roughly dividing &ldquo;website&rdquo;-ish websites from &ldquo;weblog&rdquo;-ish websites.</p>
<p>h2. Websites</p>
<p>These are often a handful of pages, at most a dozen.</p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Landing page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - These sites give you a little bit of biographical info, maybe a page or two on specific points of interest. They rarely link to any other web presences.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personal ecosystem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - These sites serve as a trampoline to send you to other sites representing the person&rsquo;s online personality. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->c.f.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pat Nakajima<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Merlin Mann<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Collection of works<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - These sites are, essentially, portfolios. They show off the cool things the person has done.</li>
</ul>
<p>h2. Weblogs</p>
<p>Chunks of content in reverse chronological listing, time and taxonomy-based archives. Sometimes comments, sometimes no. Usually a few other pages for the &ldquo;potpurri&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &ldquo;Classic&rdquo; weblog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - Writing on some focused topic or a cluster of topics. Sometimes they are a cult of personality, sometimes it&rsquo;s just a person&rsquo;s dedication to an idea. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->c.f.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daring Fireball<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Garrett Dimon<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Curated text<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - Interesting bits found on the web, aggregated and summarized. Usually higher volume than a classic weblog, but not as bad as a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; weblog. Always focused around the author&rsquo;s personal fascinations. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->c.f.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kottke<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Curated links<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - Just a collection of links, followed by a few words describing them. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->c.f.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trivium<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tumblelog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - Another sort of curation, this time with little or no summarization and a focus on a tone, subject or personality. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->c.f.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Projectionist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ideas for Dozens (tiny)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lifestream<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - An aggregation of the author&rsquo;s activities online. Like the personal ecosystem, but without the lazy linking. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->c.f.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adactio Elsewhere<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>My personal site (hint: you&rsquo;re reading it) will probably continue to evolve to include a little of each of these.</p>

<p>ActiveRecord in particular brought many ideas that made it easier for more people to program with a database.

<p>Right now, good VM technology is limited to Sun and Microsoft, while Apple, Google and Mozilla are re-inventing it for their web browsers. Open source languages, mostly, lack this VM technology.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->EventBox<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s a great idea - roll all the social/distracting applications in your life into one app so you can close it when it comes time to focus. Yesterday, I decided to give it a go.</p>
<p>I quickly felt that perhaps it was not for me. I think it comes down to posture - how is the app intended to be used? I&rsquo;ve been using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitterific<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NetNewsWire<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for quite some time (5+ years in the case of the latter), so let&rsquo;s compare with their posture:</p>
<ul>
<li>NetNewsWire is meant to scan feeds, collect the interesting stuff, read it, repeat</li>
<li>Twitterific is (beautifully) optimized for scan tweets, reply to a few, post occasionally</li>
<li>EventBox seems to encourage scanning things, handling the occasional item <em>in-situ</em>, and sending the interesting stuff to your browser</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that EventBox&rsquo;s posture is wrong; it&rsquo;s just different. I&rsquo;m going to stick with it for a few days and see how I feel about it.</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s some idealism for you: I would like to think that the future of human endeavors is congruity. There is a lot of emotional writing about rational topics. That emotion often colors the writing to the point of irrationality. It seems to me that this is because many of the prominent systems of our lives are incongrous. These inconsistent and seemingly irrational systems drive us to emotion and our logic suffers for it.</p>
<p>I’ve been reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Failed States<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Noam Chomsky. I think you could summarize it as “the U.S. government says it is doing something for reason A, but is in fact doing it for reason B”. People really dislike Ticketmaster, who would defend themselves by saying “we’re trying to make access to live music easier” but everyone knows “we’re trying to maintain a monopoly and squeeze the margin as tightly as possible”. You can play this game at home for any institution that is widely reviled.</p>
<p>Some other incongruous systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Politics: ostensibly about the will of the people, but really about the short-term interests of those with the clever lobbyists</li>
<li>Telecommunications: ostensibly about helping people communicate, but really about maintaining monopolies and minimizing the maintenance cost of those monopolies</li>
<li>Insurance: ostensibly about helping people put money away for a bad day, but really about minimizing pay-outs to maximize profit</li>
</ul>
<p>It is my hope that the businesses that emerge from this economic conflagaration are those that connect more directly with their customers. In doing so, they are more transparent. It is harder for their internal and external goals to conflict. In this way, they can profit from aligning their objectives with those of their customers. Sure, they may not make obscene profits, but that’s fine.</p>
<p>Here’s a tag-line for this congrous capitalism: “May greedy capitalism die by a thousand cuts of moderately-profitable honesty.”</p>

			 <p>At the height of the DeLay/Rove movement, I became very disenchanted with news and politics. The propaganda, the lack of reason and the generally grim outlook were causing me too much stress. So, I stopped following news. This was good for my well-being, but I felt a little guilty about not <em>understanding</em> what was going on.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years; the economy is booming and the paint is starting to peel on the Rove master plan. I&rsquo;m taking light rail to work every day, so I have some quality time for reading on my hands. I don&rsquo;t remember where I got the hunch, but I went ahead and subscribed to <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>The Economist</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to read on the train.</p>
<p>I originally let my subscription lapse, as I found it difficult to keep up with the magazine on a weekly basis. However, as the mortgage crisis peaked, I resubscribed. I&rsquo;ve found it extremely useful in trying to understand what exactly is going on, how it compares to previous downturns and as the basis for a bozo filter.</p>
<p>Regarding my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->earlier discoveries<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that everyone has an axe to grind and that the news cycle is often too short, <em>The Economist</em> is well aligned. Their axe to grind is the superiority of free markets and democratic societies. They publish weekly and cover a gamut of topics that forces them to only put ink to topics that are actually meaningful.</p>
<p>In summary: <em>The Economist</em> is a great source of news if you are wary of news sources and I heart it. It&rsquo;s a fantastic place to start understanding the non-sciences that describe our world.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here&rsquo;s a video of my talk:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s a whirlwind tour through software, abstractions, economics, finance, Mad Men, business, the messiness of life, Gossip Girl, indie developers, 30 Rock, sweating the details, product development, LOST, life&rsquo;s interconnectedness  and how awesome it is to try to understand all of this.</p>

			 <p>An admission: I didn&rsquo;t really do as many <em>awesome</em> things during the Bush administration that I would have liked to. So, now that we have a new president, I&rsquo;m going to start off right by showing you something awesome.</p>
<p>While it may seem like I&rsquo;ve had my head up in the clouds of physical computing, urbanism and monads, I&rsquo;ve been nose down in something else. I&rsquo;m super-excited to tell you, I&rsquo;ve just finished the first two episodes of &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Classy Web Development with Sinatra<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;, a screencast for the Pragmatic Programmers.</p>
<p>h2. The Particulars</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sinatra<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a great subject. As I point out in the first episode, I think it&rsquo;s very special in how it puts the smallest possible language over HTTP. Taken with the fun of building your own framework up from scratch, Sinatra apps are a ton of fun to write. Further, Sinatra really shines when you want to write micro-apps or services. Building an API for your Rails app by standing a Sinatra app up next to it to serve the API is a great approach for many applications.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve known me for a while, you probably know I had at one point aspired to write a book for the Pragmatic bookshelf. That didn&rsquo;t work out (for the better, I think), but I still wanted to produce <em>something</em> to get the good word out there. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the screencast format from the beginning, and I enjoy teaching people interactively, so the format seemed well suited to me. Plus, I&rsquo;ve always loved the sound of keys clacking in a screencast. Now you can hear <em>my</em> keys!</p>
<p>h2. Shout-outs</p>
<p>Lately, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ryan Tomayko<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been absolutely kicking ass with his contributions to Sinatra and Rack. He was kind enough to review the script before we recorded and even put out a maintenance release so that we wouldn&rsquo;t have to talk around a couple bugs that snuck into the latest release. The finished product is much better for his feedback and guidance.</p>
<p>From the beginning, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mike Clark<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been a great mentor and guide through the process of producing a screencast. He helped me write to the beginner&rsquo;s perspective and avoid speaking in a monotone. Throughout the process, he&rsquo;s been more helpful and supportive than I could have ever imagined. Needless to say, he&rsquo;s the foundation that all the goodness of the Pragmatic Screencasts series is built upon.</p>
<p>h2. I want to go to there</p>
<p>Go <!-- raw HTML omitted -->give the sampler a look<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, then <!-- raw HTML omitted -->buy the episodes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->! If you have questions, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->drop a message in the forum<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And don&rsquo;t forget to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->grab the example app<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->service<!-- raw HTML omitted --> off GitHub.</p>

			 <p>I first started trying to figure out the world, and especially politics, after September 11th. Before that, it was a topic of tangential concern. Afterwards, of course, it seemed critically important. My roommate at the time was a rather strong adherent to Fox News. I started reading weblogs that were pretty much the polar opposite in opinion. Somewhere in the middle, I frequently watched <em>The Daily Show</em>. I say they&rsquo;re in the middle because, roughly speaking, they are not left or right wing but <em>anti-idiot</em>.</p>
<p>I quickly discovered two things.</p>
<p>First, <em>everyone</em> has an axe to grind. Trying to figure out that person&rsquo;s axe is an unfortunate necessity to understanding whether they are a good source of news and opinion.</p>
<p>Second, twenty-four hour news and dozens of weblog posts a day are just too twitchy. To support that rate of production, you have to make a big deal about lots of things that are really no big deal at all. A daily news cycle is better but still intolerable. One week is the shortest term over which you can stand back and start to decide which events are meaningful.</p>
<p>Long-story short: I recognize Fox News as propaganda, dismiss CNN and MSNBC as too twitchy, realize that weblogs are too spazzy and that, in general, people are colored by their opinions and vetting them is not interesting to me.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been toying with &ldquo;Factory Girl&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/factory_girl">www.thoughtbot.com/projects/&hellip;</a> lately. The code I&rsquo;m currently working on needs to generate lots of data before tests run and Factory Girl is handling this well compared to fixtures or coding my own data generators. So, in some unrelated toying with &ldquo;DataMapper&rdquo;:<a href="http://datamapper.org/doku.php,">datamapper.org/doku.php,</a> I came to wonder if Factory Girl and DataMapper play nicely together.</p>
<p>Turns out they do! The only hitch is you need @dm-validations@ in addition to @dm-core@. Since no one seems to have written this up yet, I thought I&rsquo;d &ldquo;share my results&rdquo;:<a href="http://gist.github.com/49017.">gist.github.com/49017.</a></p>

			 <p>Ask enough people what feeds they read and you will quickly hear &ldquo;too many&rdquo; and &ldquo;I suffer from information overload.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been there too; at one time I subscribed to more than five hundred feeds. A lot of people say you can&rsquo;t really follow more than fifty feeds <em>and</em> do productive things. I&rsquo;m not the most productive guy, but I&rsquo;m comfortably following 239 feeds right now. My secrets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Man made the &ldquo;mark all as read&rdquo; command for a reason. Use it without shame.</li>
<li>Skim aggressively. If the title grabs you, check out the first few sentences. If it doesn&rsquo;t, just skim over the content and let the words and images that may jump out grab you. If they don&rsquo;t, skip to the next item.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t add feeds out of guilt or peer-pressure. Know what topics you want to read about. Add feeds that align with those topics. If a feed looks <em>really</em> awesome but doesn&rsquo;t match a topic, subscribe to it and put it in a &ldquo;Trial&rdquo; folder. Evaluate your trials every few weeks.</li>
<li>Unsubscribe if you find yourself consistently skipping all the items in a feed. NNW and Google Reader both have attention readouts that can help you decide what should go. Do this sort of pruning every few months.</li>
</ul>
<p>After reading feeds for several years, I&rsquo;m finally starting to feel like I&rsquo;m doing it right. How do I know I&rsquo;m doing it right? Because I recently thought, &ldquo;hey, I haven&rsquo;t seen enough awesome today.&rdquo; And then I open NNW and I&rsquo;ve got awesome all over me.</p>

			 <p>Ted Leung recently noted his &ldquo;blog-aversary&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2009/01/09/blogaversary/.">www.sauria.com/blog/2009&hellip;</a> This reminded me that I&rsquo;ve been reading feeds for 6-7 years. Shifting from reading centralized media like CNET, Infoworld and even Slashdot to individuals like &ldquo;Matt Webb&rdquo;:<a href="http://interconnected.org/home/,">interconnected.org/home/,</a> &ldquo;Brent Simmons&rdquo;:<a href="http://inessential.com/">inessential.com</a> and &ldquo;Simon Willison&rdquo;:<a href="http://simonwillison.net/">simonwillison.net</a> was an important event. For me, it was one of those moments where you realize there&rsquo;s a whole other world of cool stuff to discover, explore and take part in. Certainly I would have a completely different character if I hadn&rsquo;t discovered people out there on the web, doing their own cool stuff.</p>
<p>When I first started reading feeds, I experimented with some Linux stuff, most notably the crazy &ldquo;AmphetaDesk&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/.">www.disobey.com/amphetade&hellip;</a> I quickly settled into loving &ldquo;NetNewsWire&rdquo;:<a href="http://ranchero.com/.">ranchero.com/.</a> It was the first app I purchased when I got a Mac, and I still use it every day, to this day. Call me a feed reading curmudgeon, but I still think it&rsquo;s the best way to keep up with lots of sites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through some shifts in the kinds of feeds I read. I discovered feeds and blogging by &ldquo;Dave Winer&rdquo;:<a href="http://scripting.com">scripting.com</a>, so I started reading him and the people in his sphere of influence. I quickly figured out that said sphere is an odd social environment that has little relevance to what I do as a developer. For a while, I subscribed to the &ldquo;must read&rdquo; influencers, such as Boing Boing. I quickly found that firehose was too strong and, again, not relevant enough.</p>
<p>So instead of trying to figure those worlds out, I started reading more coders. Somehow that lead from reading people who do front-end coding to reading design stuff, which proved quite interesting. These days I&rsquo;ve been subscribing to people writing about &ldquo;information design&rdquo;:<a href="http://konigi.com">konigi.com</a>, &ldquo;visualization&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.flight404.com/blog,">www.flight404.com/blog,</a> &ldquo;open source hardware&rdquo;:<a href="http://tinker.it/now,">tinker.it/now,</a> &ldquo;game criticism&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com">www.rockpapershotgun.com</a> and &ldquo;urban design&rdquo;:<a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/.">bldgblog.blogspot.com/.</a> I&rsquo;m finding lots of awesome there.</p>

			 <p>The announcers of the Pittsburgh/San Diego game went on and on about what good condition the field was in. I watched the game largely because there was snow on the ground. I <em>wanted</em> the field and weather to become part of the game. We get that so rarely in Dallas.</p>
<p>For some reason, I found myself hoping the Steelers would win said game. I&rsquo;m not sure why; I&rsquo;m chalking it up to a wacky world where the <em>Cardinals</em> are going to the NFC championship.</p>
<p>If the outcomes had gone slightly different this past weekend, we could have had two interesting SuperBowl possibilities. First, Pittsburgh vs. Philadelphia, an all Pennsylvania match. Second, Kerry Collins vs. Kurt Warner, the geriatric match.</p>
<p>This is the extent to which I can write about professional sports without going into my vast conspiracy theories. One hundred words without mentioning officiating ain&rsquo;t bad, right?</p>

			 <p>Via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tinker It Now!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I ended up at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Live Control of Open Source Animation in Animata<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Therein, real-time 2.5D animation is controlled via a likeness of Mickey Mouse laden with Arduinos. Said gizmo sends data to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PureData<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, relaying data to software called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Animata<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Animata does the animation sweetness.</p>
<p>This led me down a whole rat&rsquo;s hole of awesome. &ldquo;Matt Niinimäki&rdquo;:<a href="http://originalhamsters.com/index.php">originalhamsters.com/index.php</a> &ldquo;is up to awesome things&rdquo;:<a href="http://vimeo.com/mattiniinimaki/videos.">vimeo.com/mattiniin&hellip;</a> Animata seems &ldquo;wicked cool&rdquo;:<a href="http://animata.kibu.hu/tutorials.html">animata.kibu.hu/tutorials&hellip;</a> — it&rsquo;s like digital marionettes, except not creepy. PureData, near as I can tell, is like <em>Little Big Planet</em>, but for audio/video. The &ldquo;PureData documentation&rdquo;:<a href="http://puredata.info/docs/manuals/pd/">puredata.info/docs/manu&hellip;</a> is <em>dense</em>, but there are good examples and docs included in the application (look under Help→Browser). Pd, so far, has the distinction of being more inscrutable, for me, than Haskell. I can run Haskell programs; I cannot, for my life, figure out how to make Pd patches <em>go</em>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s enumerate: &ldquo;Arduino&rdquo;:<a href="http://arduiono.cc">arduiono.cc</a> is open source hardware with a dandy little programming environment that makes writing embedded programs vastly less onerous than is typical. PureData is visual-patch-language-thing for creating audio-oriented systems with some graphics smarts on the side. Animata does interactive real-time animation. All of these great toys are open source.</p>

<p>This solution works for many things: apps in your menubar, apps in your Dock, tabs in your (Twitter, email, newsreader, etc.) folders on your Desktop, etc; anything that gets cluttered when you indulge your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NADD(nerd attention deficit disorder)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Lately, I&rsquo;m finding myself replacing free web-apps with desktop software or commercial web-apps. Some notes on that evolving philosophy herein&hellip;</p>
<p>Web applications make the most sense when people get together to create something greater than the sum of their individual parts. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GitHub<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Readernaut<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->ed. 2025 apparently this was a competitor/also-ran to Good Reads<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) are great examples. The latter, in particular because its <em>fun</em> to use, but also in its focus. The former is great in how it puts a radically different spin on the act of sharing code, and because their team is <em>kicking ass</em>.</p>
<p>I am eager to pay for continuity. Ergo, I put down money for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sifter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, GitHub and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flickr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Sure, it&rsquo;s entirely possible that any of these services will go under. Paying for them makes that less likely, and I&rsquo;m happy to vote with my dollars on an app.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Living in the cloud&rdquo; is kind of a drag. I travel just enough to want to use airplane time as a super-focused work sprint. If my links, for example, live out in the cloud, it becomes tedious to save things away while I&rsquo;m disconnected, let alone impossible to access them.</p>
<p>Ergo, I now favor web apps in spaces where getting my friends involved is more interesting and I favor paid apps or desktop apps where I want it despite my connectivity or where my friends, as great as they are, can&rsquo;t help or prove a distraction[1].</p>
<p>[1]: My friends are awesome. Its just that an app like Facebook is more of a distraction than a must-have tool. For me, at least.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>BMW and Mercedes produce cars in direct competition. Further, everyone else in the auto industry likes to use them as benchmarks. Read a car magazine and count the superlatives like &ldquo;more legroom than a Mercedes S500&rdquo; or &ldquo;more horsepower than a BMW 330i&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a market out there; everyone is incentivized to produce better stuff every time around.</p>
<p>However, you won&rsquo;t ever find them boasting about top speed[1]. BMW or Mercedes don&rsquo;t make cars that go faster than 155 MPH. Many moons ago, these car makers made a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gentlemen&rsquo;s agreement<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to limit their cars to a certain top speed. They probably did this for safety reasons - there just isn&rsquo;t much need to go that fast and it&rsquo;s inadvisable for most folks.</p>
<p>Why adhere to these agreements? At any point, BMW or Mercedes could break this agreement and achieve some kind of short-term numerical superiority. But this would end in an arms race that doesn&rsquo;t really improve the every-day usage of their cars. So really, it’s in each company&rsquo;s interest to <em>maintain</em> the agreement.</p>
<p>In the land of software development, we have gentlemen&rsquo;s agreements as well. When I picked up Python in 1999, I learned that they didn&rsquo;t have a distinction between public, protected and private object attributes. Many decried this, but the general idea was that we’re all adults and do the responsible thing.</p>
<p>Fast forward six years. At first I was somewhat skeptical of how Rails modifies the standard Ruby libraries. Many people are still put off about this. But I&rsquo;m OK with it. If you have the chance to drive improvements in an ecosystem without waiting for the core maintainers to release a new version of Ruby, why not?</p>
<p>Many also decry the situation we find around Rails plugins. It&rsquo;s argued that one shouldn&rsquo;t go  mucking about inside Rails to add functionality. And sure enough, plugins sometimes break when the core team changes Rails, even in the slightest of ways.</p>
<p>No surprise, I&rsquo;m fine with this. Improving a system from the inside is too appealing to pass up so that I can claim some kind of virtuousness.</p>
<p>Should Rails have a defined internal interface or extension mechanism? Sure, sounds great! But we shouldn&rsquo;t stop improving it outside the Rails core process just because sometimes we get burned.</p>
<p>The alternative is to define a known set of hooks by which we can modify behavior in a post-hoc fashion. Merb took this approach, and I&rsquo;m eager to see how it works out. My take is that limiting people to extension along axes that the core developers imagined in a pre-hoc manner is too limiting. I hope I am proven wrong.</p>
<p>When it comes to Ruby or Rails, I think we already have a gentlemen&rsquo;s agreement. We accept that extending systems using the facilities Ruby provides is useful, so we don&rsquo;t complain too much when we get burned[2]. Accepting this is, in my experience, an empowering aspect of using Ruby that lets me worry about really interesting problems.</p>
<p>[1] Except maybe for the M and AMG tuner variants of their mass-production cars
[2] where &ldquo;too much&rdquo; is defined by the prudence of the extension mechanism used</p>

			 <p>Since I started using Git, I&rsquo;ve been finding myself creating tons of repositories. Anything I think might <em>someday</em> prove interesting or that I work on for more than a few minutes, I create a Git repository. I&rsquo;ve yet to discover that <em>ultimate</em> workflow, but between experimenting with using it to put <!-- raw HTML omitted -->presentations<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->online<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->managing the Dallas.rb website via Git<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->using it extensively at FiveRuns<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Git is proving quite fun.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s get back to that earlier point: I have a metric shit-ton of repositories laying around in my home directory. This morning I found myself wondering exactly how many I have and how many actually have a remote (i.e. how many have yielded a project worth backing up remotely and/or sharing). So, I did the numbers:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Which is about what I&rsquo;d expect in terms of quantity and ratio. I&rsquo;m a little surprised I have so many work repositories laying around, but we use submodules extensively so there&rsquo;s probably only about 40 repositories that are meaningful to us. I&rsquo;m a little suprised that so many of my personal projects do have remotes though. I guess I&rsquo;m making progress towards <!-- raw HTML omitted -->doing more<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Chris Wanswrath, a smart and distinguished fellow, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->advises us to burn our news readers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and just &ldquo;hear it through the grapevine.&rdquo; But how far can one go with that?</p>
<p>For myself, reading feeds gets me a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aesthetic where I have none. Feeds like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BLDGBLOG<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Coudal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> point me to things that make me better at what I do, in a tangential way, and a more interesting person. These are things that otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t know where to start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awareness on the edges. Reading folks like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simon Willison<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jason Kottke<!-- raw HTML omitted --> make sure that interesting topics in programming or erudition don&rsquo;t go unseen even though I am focused on that topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aggregation of ideas. This cuts two ways. Most people worth reading compress a bunch of different sources down to a manageable stream. This gives me more bang for the buck in my feed reading time. On the other hand, if a link is mentioned several times in the aggregate of feeds I subscribe to, then its probably worth checking out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I can see how following interesting folks on Twitter and reading aggregators occasionally can you get you some of this, but not all of it. With sources like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reddit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hacker News<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, signal to noise is a problem - you can&rsquo;t control who posts what. Some people have a lot of extra angst and/or spare time. Which is also the other side of the Twitter story. Some people are great to read, but a pain to put up with at times. So it goes.</p>
<p>When Chris' essay first hit the wires, I was tempted to adopt his ways. But, I think I&rsquo;m pretty good at ignoring the need to unbold things and cut down to business. What has proved immensely useful to me was has encouragement to just code all the time and make lots of stuff. I&rsquo;m just getting started with this, but already I&rsquo;m liking the increased feeling of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Regardless, we could all probably stand to trim our feed lists and hunker down on our projects, no?</p>

<p>In my RailsConf Europe 2008 presentation, I play the role of the messenger. I&rsquo;m not bringing any new science that makes building more involved applications easier. Instead, I&rsquo;m trying to tie it together into an understandable package. You take the gems described herein (money, acts_as_state_machine and acts_as_versioned) and a couple concepts (domain driven design and queueing) and you can build some really cool applications that solve pretty tricky problems.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>Guns, Germs and Steel</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is one of those essential books that makes more sense of the world. Specifically, it address in rational terms, how it came to be that the modern world is arranged as it is where it concerns the haves and have-nots on the global scale.</p>
<p>The author, Jared Diamond, does so by taking an extremely long view on history, over the course of the last ten thousand plus years). From there he tries to build models and theories that predict why some societies advanced faster than others. To make a long story short, the societies that have become the contemporary first world were able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move knowledge and technology on an east-west axis, an axis that allows easy migration and translation of farming knowledge because the climate is roughly the same</li>
<li>Develop immunity to epidemic diseases like small-pox that are tied to living near agriculture, thus making them less likely to get killed off by certain foreign invaders or to kill off natives as they travel to foreign lands</li>
<li>Organize people into ever-large structures that can sustain invasions, research and other useful forms of specialization</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there&rsquo;s more to it than that. It&rsquo;s a great read and illuminates all sorts of topics I&rsquo;d never even thought of, let alone correlated. If you, like me, seek a greater understanding of the abstracts that define the world, this is a book for you.</p>

			 <p>Designing software is a tricky thing. It&rsquo;s tempting to front-load it on a project. That won&rsquo;t work because the start of a project is when you know the least about it. So some folks try to do as little design as possible. I&rsquo;m guilty of this. However, that can lead to software that doesn&rsquo;t adequately express the problem it&rsquo;s trying to solve. Further, there is often a temptation to over-design software with lots of ceremony and architecture. Contrary to this is the temptation to not design it at all, which again leads to software that doesn&rsquo;t express itself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book that draws a reasonable compromise between these forces. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to read Eric Evans' <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>Domain Driven Design</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --> for a while now. The emphasis of the book is in collaborating with domain experts and other developers to find the essence of the problem space and then express that in software (as objects). I&rsquo;ve often pointed out the utility of building applications from the language up and the problem domain down. DDD focuses precisely on the latter.</p>
<p>One of the core concepts in the book is the <em>ubiquitous language</em> that is used to describe the problem at hand. This language is used by the domain experts (customers) <em>and</em> the developers. The language is then woven into the design of the system. This leads to software that is more likely to succeed, both in business terms and in terms of development effort. Evans spends the first part of the book describing the particulars of this language.</p>
<p>He then moves on to describing the technical side of the software. Entities, value objects, services, factories, modules and repositories are terms I was already somewhat familiar with that Evans gave a more crisp and satisfying definition to. For most people, this is probably the tasty meat of the book, illuminating the way from a competent developer to an outstanding developer.</p>
<p>The last part of the book focuses on the larger scale issues of deep design. I was particularly pleased that he covers how software design is affected by various good and bad social issues. It also gives a strategic view of the forest, where most books on software development focus on a more tactical view of each tree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fond of pointing out books that are inflection points in my way of thinking about software development. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Code Complete<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Pragmatic Programmer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, The Dragon Book and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My Job Went To India<!-- raw HTML omitted --> all fall under this category. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Domain Driven Design<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is certainly the latest edition. It makes sense of trends I see in great software and illuminates a path to make software like it myself.</p>
<p>If reading this review didn&rsquo;t make you want to vomit, you should probably read the book posthaste.</p>

			 <p>I didn&rsquo;t manage to touch on this in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What Has Ruby Done For You Lately<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Io<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a really impressive language. Mostly in the minimal number of concepts one needs to grasp in order to deeply understand the language.</p>
<p>To pick on Java (sorry), a list of concepts you need in order to grasp Java:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primitive types</li>
<li>Objects</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Interfaces</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Iteration</li>
<li>Conditionals</li>
<li>Operators</li>
<li>Type casting</li>
<li>Generics</li>
<li>Method calls</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m missing some. Further, that&rsquo;s just what you need to write a program with <em>one class</em>. To build a realistic system you need to know about class paths, packages and all sorts of arcane details.</p>
<p>In comparison, to build a simplistic Io program, you need to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lazy evaluation</li>
<li>Objects as prototypes</li>
<li>Short circuit evaluation</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>Closures</li>
</ul>
<p>That list ended up about twice as long as I thought it would, actually. Really, all the average practicing programmer needs to learn is prototypes and lazy evaluation.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Refactor my code<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a neat site where you can post your code and watch others refactor it. I saw an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interesting bit of code<!-- raw HTML omitted --> whiz past and thought I&rsquo;d <!-- raw HTML omitted -->take a crack at it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Removing conditionals from code is one of the little games I sometimes play while coding. Here, I&rsquo;ve extracted the logic of the conditional into another class. The resulting class is <em>much more</em> code than the original. So why do that?</p>
<p>Well, I say you get a few benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The logic is now far easier to test. It&rsquo;s a standalone object now rather than a Rails functional test.</li>
<li>The flow of what&rsquo;s being done and tested is more decomposed and easier to follow.</li>
<li>Most importantly, the code explains itself. No need for comments (which will undoubtedly go out of sync over time) here!</li>
</ul>
<p>While I delight in deleting code and writing as little as possible, refactoring this to <em>more</em> code seems the right way. What say you?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update: Make sure you check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Marcel Molina&rsquo;s refactoring<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Its probably better than mine ;)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yurii Rashkovskii&rsquo;s Blog: Top 10 Reasons to Avoid Document Databases FUD<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve come upon this sort of idea several time recently (and the above was written a couple months ago). I&rsquo;m warming up to the idea. Without piles of cash and able systems-type folks, scaling databases out is a really nasty problem. Even then, my reading is there are definite bounds for how far you can go.</p>
<p>Assembling datasets on the more easily scaled app server is appealing. It sounds fun (hey, real programming!) and is interesting to think about. But I wonder if it leads to having to figure out consistency in your application. From where I sit, its the hardest part of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ACID<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  to reason with.</p>

<p>Back when I worked in a semi-.NET shop, we needed to cache some pretty expensive operations somewhere. In memory would have been ideal, but we had no way to coordinate between application servers. It ended up going in the database, because that made everyone feel safe. In hindsight, it probably wasn&rsquo;t the greatest idea.</p>
<p>Long story short, my internal clock that tells me how long it will take Microsoft to clone a forehead-slappingly-obvious-idea is well set.</p>

			 <p>Pro-tip: if you&rsquo;re using submodules with Git to manage dependencies (say Rails plugins), you can get yourself into trouble. Like half-a-day of wasted trouble.</p>
<p>The rub comes when you need to make a change to some plugin. Suppose you were using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brain Buster<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for your captcha and then decided you need to make a change. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@git submodule@<!-- raw HTML omitted --> command doesn&rsquo;t really seem to offer a way to change the URL for the submodule.

<p>h2{color: #f00}. The Wrong Way</p>
<ul>
<li>Fork/create your own version of the submodule in question</li>
<li>Change the URL for the submodule in @.git/config@ and @.gitmodules@</li>
<li>Cross your fingers and hope for the best</li>

<p>h2. The Right Way</p>
<ul>
<li>Fork/create your own version of the submodule in question</li>
<li>Remove references to the existing submodule in @.git/config@, @.gitmodules@ and nuke the submodule directory</li>
<li>Commit</li>
<li>Add the new submodule URL</li>
<li>Commit</li>
<li>Make changes in your submodule</li>
<li>Commit changes in the submodule (not the parent project)</li>
<li>Commit the changes in the parent project (otherwise you&rsquo;ll only get the old version of the submodule in future pulls)</li>

			 <p>Yesterday I spoke to a pleasant mix of Java, .NET, Ruby, Python and PHP developers at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dallas TechFest<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. My goal when speaking to enthusiast crowds of this sort is to show the light that I&rsquo;ve found in my programming journeys over the past couple years. This time around I tried to take a page from the inimitable <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Richard Feynman<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by structuring my talk into two sets of &ldquo;Six Easy Pieces&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The first part starts off with the stance that <em>programming shouldn&rsquo;t suck</em>. From there I talk about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->intercontinental railroad<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sapir-Whorf<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pattern Languages<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gang of Four<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and flattery. In the end, we have an idea of how to better approach programming so we can have fun doing it.</p>
<p>The second half is partially showing off Ruby and partially a gauntlet thrown down to other languages. The main point is to show a progression of ideas I see in lots of Ruby code, from sensible naming to closures ending up with metaprogramming powering declarative programming and internal DSLs. You can implement the ideas from the beginning in any language. However, the ideas towards the end require a more progressively designed language. I&rsquo;d love to see non-Ruby implementations of the programs towards the end of the presentation, if only for comparison and Rosetta Stone purposes.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who was in attendance and especially those who stopped to chat with me before and after the presentation. Without further ado, please enjoy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six Easy Pieces (Twice Over)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;I need a new drug&rdquo;:http://youtube.com/watch?v=MMSFX1Vb3xQ. One that won&rsquo;t quit. One that will let me sensibly structure the use of blocks in Ruby such that they can run across multiple lines and yet still chain blocks together.</p>
<p>OK, so its not really a <em>drug</em> I need, per se. Though, I&rsquo;m sure what Huey Lewis really needed was a new drug. But what I need is a convention, or perhaps some syntax. It should say to you, &ldquo;HEY. Adam&rsquo;s doing something clever with blocks here. Keep your eyes open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I find myself desiring a new syntax and/or convention, when using blocks. I&rsquo;ve been trying to write in a more functional style lately, especially a pure-functional style wherein you never call a method for its side-effects. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m the only person doing this. Jim Weirich sort of alluded to it in a post about &ldquo;when to use @do/end@ vs. braces&rdquo;:http://onestepback.org/index.cgi/Tech/Ruby/BraceVsDoEnd.rdoc. Rick DeNatale &ldquo;took it a step further&rdquo;:http://talklikeaduck.denhaven2.com/articles/2007/10/02/ruby-blocks-do-or-brace. I want to lay it bare.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with something innocuous:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You get the value back of each object in the array, <em>mapped</em> to the result of calling the block. Fun times. Now, let&rsquo;s put it on one line and do something clever with it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now we&rsquo;re cooking! Ruby&rsquo;s syntax allows us to chain methods <em>and</em> blocks. Which turns out nice in this case where I want to filter down the array of mapped values. But let&rsquo;s pretend we need to do something clever in those blocks.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That&rsquo;s the best I could come up with for chained, multi-line blocks. It looks &ldquo;Weirichian&rdquo;. Despite that, it kinda makes me vomit in my mouth.</p>
<p>So, since &ldquo;I got awesome feedback on my last question of taste&rdquo;:http://therealadam.com/archive/2008/04/28/can-i-send-you-a-message/, I&rsquo;m tapping you, my favorite Ruby developer, for more. The ground rules are that you can&rsquo;t extract the logic into a real method and you can&rsquo;t jam everything onto one line. You <em>have</em> to use multi-line blocks. What looks good to you here?</p>

			 <p>@Object#send@ - the joy of Rubyists and the scourge of those who would write refactoring tools. Let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
<p>I recently ended up writing some code that would have proven really hideous if I couldn&rsquo;t call @#send@. So I had a class like the following (written using code generation for brevity):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I needed to call @one@, @two@ or @three@ from a bit of code that takes some user input (in this case, an attribute value in a template language). So I cooked something like this up:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I&rsquo;m using a case statement to convert <em>valid</em> method names to symbols, which I then pass to @#send@ and <em>bam!</em>, my method is called. This made my code a ton easier to write and I&rsquo;m here espousing the technique to you.</p>
<p>But what is the drawback? Well, if someone were to ever really get up the courage to tackle the task of building a refactoring browser for Ruby, this sort of thing would give them fits. They can&rsquo;t really tell where those methods are called on my class until they are actually called. Heck, given the code above, they can&rsquo;t even figure out what methods exist on @Foo@ without running the code.</p>
<p>The other drawback is that this code is a little hard to read. Most new casual Rubyists won&rsquo;t think to search for the symbol version of a method name. Its even harder if you&rsquo;re still somewhat new to Ruby and you aren&rsquo;t aware this sort of thing even happens.</p>
<p>For me personally, the concise code I can write with @#send@ far outweighs the drawbacks. I preach the importance of code reading regularly, and its how one can get over the &ldquo;hump&rdquo; that is knowing how to navigate software that sends dynamic messages to objects.</p>
<p>Your homework is to share how you feel about @#send@ in the comments.</p>

I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do something like this at a BarCamp for a while now. Personally, one of my favorite past-times at conferences is to shoulder surf other people. The idea above takes shoulder surfing, turns it around and formalizes it.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ding Ding Ding!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> We have a winner. Anders Hejlsberg is quite possibly the most clued-in designer of a mainstream programming language. The work that Anders Hejlsberg  is doing with C# is amazingly progressive and forward thinking. He&rsquo;s putting ideas like lambdas, type inference and anonymous classes in a mainstream languages used by armies of programmers. This, to a programming language nerd like myself, is a big deal.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the motivation behind all this? Well, he started off by saying that data does not equal objects. We&rsquo;ve got data in XML, databases and all manners of weird files. Thus begat <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LINQ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Language Integrated Query) which makes querying data a first class citizen in C#. In doing so, you start to insinuate a declarative language inside an imperative one.</p>
<p>During his quick tour of LINQ, Anders made a point to emphasize his idea that &ldquo;we over-specify the solution&rdquo; in our programs, leaving little room for the execution infrastructure to do intelligent things. He shows some imperative code for ordering, grouping and filtering data, basically a rats nest of loops and conditionals. Using LINQ he refactors the code down to a simple, albeit SQL-ish query.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve declared just the essence of your program to the implementation, it can do clever things to make it go faster. For instance, there&rsquo;s a parallel version of LINQ in the works. Your average developers gets this &ldquo;for free&rdquo; by expressing his queries in LINQ. Thankfully, LINQ is just sugar for a straight-up .NET API, so the younger generation of developers who have never used SQL, let alone @malloc@ can still play. ;)</p>
<p>When he was wrapping up, Anders made a comment that, in the future, they are looking into making languages more like services. I think this is a strategy that they share with Sun &ndash; it&rsquo;s not so much about Java or C# as the interesting runtime bits they ship with. I&rsquo;m not sure <!-- raw HTML omitted -->where<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this idea will go, but I like the sound of it.</p>
<p>Some other great Anders pseudo-quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure Functional programming is fantastic&hellip;the only problem is that it doesn&rsquo;t work for real applications</li>
<li>Transactional memory is the string theory of computer science</li>
<li>Dynamic versus static typing is a pendulum that is currently swung towards the dynamic side. The answer is somewhere down the middle. (I think he&rsquo;s doing a pretty decent job of dragging mainstream languages towards the middle)</li>
<li>Languages shouldn&rsquo;t solve a problem until the solutions is known. Otherwise, you just slap a bunch of crap onto your language.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was my favorite presentation of the week. I&rsquo;m looking forward to talking to friends who use C# about the clever programming tricks I use every day in Ruby. And it should prove fun to gang up on Java folks too! ;)</p>

			 <p>In a former life, I worked in a Microsoft shop. So I&rsquo;m not completely foreign to the Microsoft development tool landscape. At the time, C# and .NET were just slightly better than Java, from my perspective as a language nerd. Lucky for me, I haven&rsquo;t done extensive work in J2EE frameworks <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ASP.NET so I have no frame of reference for how they compared at the time.</p>
<p>Given my obvious interest in languages, frameworks and how that affects what programmers build, I enjoyed hearing about the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ASP.NET MVC<!-- raw HTML omitted --> framework from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott Guthrie<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The most promising thing about this tool, to me, is that MS is guiding people down the unit testing path by default. I don&rsquo;t know if any other Visual Studio tools are doing this, but it&rsquo;s a pretty big deal to me. I think that right now only the most enthusiastic programmers do some any form of TDD or BDD. Putting it in the hands of &ldquo;vocational&rdquo; programmers has the promise to significantly raise the state of the art in programming. As a side note, it was interesting to observe that 40-50% of the audience raised their hand about doing TDD and 33-50% raised their hand for using an MVC framework.</p>
<p>The framework itself is nothing surprising if you&rsquo;ve looked at Rails, Django, CodeIgniter, et. al. What was interesting to me is to see how the framework is colored by running in the CLR. On the plus side, you get LINQ and a really good VM. On the downside, you have to use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for<!-- raw HTML omitted --> loops and nullable types (wink, nudge). The rest is pretty much what you&rsquo;d expect to see when you transliterate an MVC framework to C#, though they did display some creativity in making it decent to look at in terms of code style.</p>
<p>There was a pretty strong message that the tool is cross-platform (works with Mono) and cross-language. You can write a model in C#, a controller in Ruby and a view in Python. Scott even suggested that you could write unit tests in PHP, to which I thought, &ldquo;PLEASE GOD NO!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scott a somewhat typical response, &ldquo;Hey, I did this in Smalltalk in 1974!&rdquo; &ndash; funny because it&rsquo;s true. He also acknowledged its not for everyone. Some people need a car and some people need a motorcycle. Even so, the ideas that MS is putting in front of <em>a ton</em> of programmers are progressive and important. That&rsquo;s the most important part to me.</p>

			 <p>So, as I&rsquo;ve alluded, I&rsquo;m at Microsoft Intergalactic Headquarters this week for the Microsoft Technology Summit. The crux of the biscuit here is to invite people from communities not using Microsoft technology and show them what Microsoft is up to.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s particular emphasis on what MS is doing in the Open Source Software space. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sam Ramji<!-- raw HTML omitted --> opened up the event to give us a sort of rundown on what MS is now doing in OSS and interoperability. I was unaware that IIS7 will support PHP, that MS is changing their practices to suit the Samba project or that HyperV will, in part get released as OSS.</p>
<p>Sam mentioned that he is committed to not confusing Open Source and Shared Source. It&rsquo;s a slight distinction to most people but it really tends to rankle those who know the difference. I think he best summed it up by saying <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OSS at MS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is in year 3 of a 10 year project and to judge it by what they actually do, and not their overtures (big nod to Ballmer rattling sabers about OSS and patent litigation).</p>
<p>Next up, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kevin Schofield<!-- raw HTML omitted --> showed off some of the work <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MS Research<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been doing. His first point was that research <!-- raw HTML omitted -->does<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pay off. Research money into technologies like VLSI, databases, parallel databases and workstations have yielded multi-billion dollar industries. Projects that start out as pure academics can evolve into major players such as Oracle and Sun.</p>
<p>MS Research&rsquo;s mission is to advance the state of the CS art and ensure that MS has a future. By the latter, he means that MSR is a hedge on the company&rsquo;s agility. They don&rsquo;t want to turn a corner and find customers demanding something that MS doesn&rsquo;t know about.</p>
<p>To this end, they hire the best researchers around and then don&rsquo;t tell them what to do. In this way, they refer to themselves as the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s largest CS department&rdquo;. However, knowledge transfer is critical. If they don&rsquo;t transfer technology to the product groups, what they&rsquo;ve done is useless.</p>
<p>I found it very interesting that Kevin said &ldquo;tech transfer is a social process.&rdquo; For this reason, he specifically hires people with good relationship management. People Hacks at work ya&rsquo;ll!</p>

<p>After reading this, I immediately realized the Edge Case is definitely an anti-pattern of teamwork. I&rsquo;ve observed, suffered and inflicted this particular tactic countless times in the past.</p>
<p>Tackling this one is three-pronged:</p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Recognize it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> When someone points out an edge-case, quickly try to establish with the rest of the team whether this occurrence is as rare as you think it is or whether its truly important.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neutralize it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If it really is a corner case, mark it as such and get back to making <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actual progress<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bury it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Should you throw something out there and find its really an edge case, let it go. Don&rsquo;t be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> guy.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;But Adam&rdquo;, you say. &ldquo;It would be really embarrassing if we omitted a condition for the Blurbleflaster Case!&rdquo; Well, I couldn&rsquo;t even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->find<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Blurbleflaster Case in Wikipedia! So, if someone finds that we&rsquo;ve omitted it, then they get the prize; it won&rsquo;t be the end of the world. We should probably implement that whole social network thing first anyway.</p>

			 <p>Tonight I gave a presentation on Rails 2 at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dallas.rb<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Within, I note some of my favorite new things in Rails 2. Some things small, some things large.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you weren&rsquo;t there, I should probably explain a couple of the slides. I think Rails 2 is, despite its whole-numberness, an evolutionary release. It makes the Rails &ldquo;language&rdquo; smoother around the edges. Granted, its still somewhat blob-esque, but its getter rounder. I dig it.</p>
<p>Besides that, I think Active Resource, or ARes as they call it in the biz, is going to prove useful mostly behind the firewall in your datacenter. As you build more and more applications, you&rsquo;ll find you need to use resources across multiple apps. This is exactly where ARes shines &ndash; providing a common user service, for example.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So everyone&rsquo;s probably gonna spill ink on this one. Understandably &ndash; in Flickr, Upcoming and del.icio.us you&rsquo;ve got three of the most trusted and loved sites out in their respective communities. In addition, there&rsquo;s a lot of respected people, both in web development and open source, at Yahoo. Joining Microsoft, an organization with minimal respect in the web development and open source communities, would reduce those people&rsquo;s cred right out of the gate.</p>
<p>Were this bid successful, here&rsquo;s what I hope would happen. Microsoft uses it as an opportunity to rebuild organizationally. Bury the hatchet with open source and open up the development of Internet Explorer. Yahoo continues building apps like Flickr and del.icio.us like they always have. A rewrite on .NET technologies isn&rsquo;t imposed like it was on Hotmail. In the end, Microsoft becomes an organization where closed source, proprietary development can flourish with open source, standards-based processes.</p>
<p>This is wild guessing on my part. That said, if you look at Microsoft, its clear they are having major execution problems. Xbox is the only group that is widely successful and even they have hardware problems. All the other groups are missing timelines and customer/developer expectations. Just like Yahoo was before they picked up Flickr, del.icio.us, Upcoming, etc.</p>
<p>If Yahoo can make acquisitions to rebuild their culture, perhaps Microsoft can too.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ed. revised Feb 15, 2025. Turns out this didn&rsquo;t happen, but my predictions did reify with the Microsoft acquisition of GitHub. Also, it&rsquo;s hard to remember the moment when Yahoo was ascendant! Take care what you wish for?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->FACT<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I like Prototype better. It fits the way I program perfectly. I like prototypes, I like programming in a somewhat functional style. I don&rsquo;t think of things in a DOM-centric way. I&rsquo;m OK with having client-side state.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->FICTION<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: jQuery is the &ldquo;emo&rdquo; framework. Apparently it (was) the &ldquo;new wave&rdquo; framework. Either way, I will always hold it against John Resig that he chose Devo hats as the logo.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->FACT<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: jQuery is a fine framework if you think in terms of the DOM or don&rsquo;t do much back-end programming.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->FICTION<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: To become proficient at Prototype, you have to punch the first jQuery user you see every day. I have never punched a jQuery user. Attempts to verbally duck punch them have met with minimal success.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->FACT<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Dollar functions are sexy. Clearly one of the best abuses of a programming language grammar, ever.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->FICTION<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: You can&rsquo;t write unobtrusive JS with Prototype. I wrote a tutorial for <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Advanced Rails Recipes<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> on how to do that with Dan Webb&rsquo;s lovely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LowPro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> library.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->FACT<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: We can all agree, YUI is really unpleasant to look at.  ENOUGH.with.the.fourteen.dots.before.I.can.do.something.useful!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->FICTION<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Sam Stephenson is an artificial intelligence akin to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GLaDOS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;ve met Sam twice. He did not attempt to coerce me into an incinerator.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve got the record straight, I&rsquo;ll leave you with a comparison. To my jaded, biased and stubborn eyes, trying to use jQuery feels limiting. But I think that&rsquo;s particular to my experience and preference. No doubt, if jQuery were a musical instrument, it&rsquo;d be akin to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stevie Ray Vaughn&rsquo;s guitar &ldquo;First Wife&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: suited to its user, iconic and specifically built to its purpose. If you were to try and play a Beethoven piano sonata on First Wife, it just wouldn&rsquo;t come out right. However, your basic baby grand piano is equally suited to Beethoven <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or<!-- raw HTML omitted --> B. B. King. So in my tortured metaphor, Prototype is a piano &ndash; harder to play well, but more rewarding once you do.</p>

<p>That said, any experienced NNW user knows that information overload is easy to get yourself into and hard to elude once you&rsquo;re wrapped in its grasp. The very manly Merlin Mann brought us <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inbox Zero<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I knew I needed to strive for Feeds Zero, in addition to browser-tab zero, Twitter-zero, etc. Unfortunately, Feeds Zero can lead to dozens of open browser tabs in NNW. Fortunately, NNW is better than any other WebKit app I&rsquo;ve seen at dealing with this.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;ve got a ton of browser tabs in NNW holding down my soul. A contemporary, first-world problem. In trying to keep up with feeds, one spawns many dozens of browser windows. Lots of stuff to read. But, the sheer mass of 100+ tabs is considerable friction holding you back from, you know, acquiring all that information.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my current situation:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I get myself into it pretty frequently. I bet you do too. Here&rsquo;s how I get through it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In NNW, Cmd-Shift-Left and Cmd-Shift-Right move you up and down the vertical tab bar. Sometimes what I see in the first several tabs just isn&rsquo;t appealing at the moment, though I can easily convince myself that my future self will find it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->intriguing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So I just turn around and head the other way. I might find something I like in that direction.</p>
<p>In fact, if you just finished some un-bolding, the newest, freshest links will end up closer to the Cmd-Shift-Right side of the list. In theory, your current self found that intriguing enough that you could actually start reading it now. ;)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I&rsquo;ve alluded, sometimes your past self just has poor taste. Your former self pulled up some article that you know, really, you&rsquo;re only barely interested in reading. Or maybe you just felt guilty <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reading it, but you still wanted to unbold it.</p>
<p>Look, sometimes your Attention Bush needs trimming. Cmd-W is your friend, people. It makes the pain go away, no matter what app you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve found the first two tricks weren&rsquo;t helping me. My tab list just grew and grew. The guilt became intolerable. So I rebooted. Kinda.</p>
<p>Tab-&gt;Export Tabs in NNW is my new best friend. I used it to export all my tabs to an HTML file. Then I sorted the list in TextMate, so as to collect everything by author, rather than over time. I&rsquo;ve been pulling a few links off this list every now and then. Once they&rsquo;re in my real web browser, I remove them from the list.</p>
<p>A couple days in, I&rsquo;m already a fourth of the way through the list. And I&rsquo;ve been able to guiltlessly tackle my feeds. Happy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have an AppleScript that tells me how many tabs I have open in NNW. It&rsquo;s vital for telling me whether I should focus on &ldquo;feed zero&rdquo; or &ldquo;tab zero&rdquo;. You can see the window it displays the count in the screenshot above. Here&rsquo;s the code of the script:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Stick it in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->~/Library/Application Support/NetNewsWire/Scripts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it will appear in the Script Menu for NNW. I like to use the Keyboard Preferences pane to bind the script to Control-Cmd-C for quick use.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So. I&rsquo;ve given you some chisels that you can use to work down that attention boulder you&rsquo;ve made for yourself. Just remember that the goal is to acquire new and fascinating information <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and still get stuff done.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Keeping those <!-- raw HTML omitted -->attention sails<!-- raw HTML omitted --> well trimmed is the best way to avoid hundreds of NNW browser tabs.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that when I&rsquo;m walking about, sort of thinking idly, I find myself asking &ldquo;How?&rdquo;  How was that building constructed?  Why is that sewer there, and not somewhere else?  OK, I guess that one is really a why question.  So I suppose the underlying curiosity is really about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mechanism<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the world.</p>
<p>Sure, you can&rsquo;t reduce the world to a mechanism, a machine.  It&rsquo;s full of humans, so you can&rsquo;t really make any kind of useful predictions.  But there are definitely systems in place and some are more influential than others.  Some of those systems, while not predictable machines, do display tendencies and trends.  Learning them is one of the little intellectual side-journeys I&rsquo;ve been immersing myself in lately.</p>
<p>If you want to play along, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m into at the moment:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For the former, I encourage you to listen to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Economist Podcast (iTunes)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and read the weekly edition when you get the opportunity.  They also seem to have moved away from using a pay-wall, so check out the articles on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Economist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> website as well.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering why on earth economics might be interesting, then check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Baroque Cycle<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I never thought I&rsquo;d wish I understood macroeconomics and financial instruments so that I could figure out what&rsquo;s going on in a book by a cyberpunk author.  But then I read the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Baroque Cycle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I did.  Its no coincidence the last of the cycle is titled <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The System of the World<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and here I am, seeking a system that illuminates the world.</p>
<p>For cognitive science and linguistics, I&rsquo;m still just getting started.  I read <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Introducing Linguistics<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> this summer and its great.  It seems its part of a series where they match a subject matter expert with a graphic designer.  The result is easily read but highly informative.  Its very much in the same style as Kathy Sierra.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ahead of me here and know a good bit on any of these subjects, feel free to drop some suggestions on what I should read next!</p>

			 <p>Is your knowledge as a programmer tall like they sky or broad like the horizon?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Counter-point: your must prune your knowledge so that it is deep <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> broad.  I spoke to this in my OSCON presentation <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Holistic Programmer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  From my description:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Therein, I talk of my approach to problem solving.  My method is largely predicated on knowing a little bit about a whole lot.  I usually frame a problem pretty quickly and get on to making the first attempt at solving it.  I might get lucky and actually frame the problem correctly.  If I don&rsquo;t, at least now I&rsquo;ve got an idea of what the problem <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is and I can take another, more informed stab.  So on this, Greg Knauss and I disagree.</p>
<p>My main point is that programmers need to take a holistic approach these days, knowing things above and below them in the application or system stack in which they are expert.  This is the deep part that Greg mentions.  Its not enough to just speak Rails, Django, Linux or Flash.  You have to understand the bits that are higher level and the bits that are lower level than what you are working on.  Otherwise you&rsquo;re looking at an incomplete picture.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a notion going around of the &ldquo;specializing generalists&rdquo; or some such.  I think it&rsquo;s a great way to go.  Given the rapid rate of change in software development, you have to stay nimble.  The ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and approaches separates the mediocre programmers from the great programmers.</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago, Dan Cederholm, of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simple Bits<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fame, launched <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Foamee<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Foamee lets you track to whom you owe beers.  The twist?  You manage your beer debt via Twitter.  Its a small little app.  It only does one thing.  Its got a fantastic entry-point.  In other words, its <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really cool<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Erik Kastner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reminded me of his app <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Band Named<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this week.  It finally clicked why its cool this time.  Games like Guitar Hero III and Rock Band want you to name your ethereal band.  Band Named is a great place to post ideas for said names.  The neat thing about Erik&rsquo;s app is that you can sign in via OpenID (+1) and then fetch your avatar from Flickr or Twitter (FTW).  The entry of new band names is easy.  And its fun!</p>
<p>I hope this turns into a trend-buzz-meme thing.  The world needs more apps that aim to just help you out now and then, not ones that want to become your task management, knowledge capture workflow mega-gizmo-jobby.  Better yet, apps that are loosely coupled via infrastructure you&rsquo;re already using (Flickr, Twitter, OpenID, etc.) taste great.</p>
<p>Plus, these little efforts needn&rsquo;t result in all-pain, no gain.  Dan probably can&rsquo;t support himself on it, but I bet any money made from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Foamee merch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will come in handy.  Likewise, there are lots of things you could do with something like Band Named, though I don&rsquo;t know if Erik&rsquo;s going to take it that direction.</p>
<p>So, call to action: hatch up some idea.  Make sure its a little crazy.  If pitching it to a VC would get you laughed out of the room, you&rsquo;re on the right track.  If you think the commenters on TechCrunch would skewer you, you&rsquo;re getting even warmer.  Think Uncov would just laugh and point?  You&rsquo;ve probably hit the jackpot.  Now: go out, build the sucker and figure out how to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have fun with it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with this: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->its all about getting to the point where you&rsquo;re making dough <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> having fun.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>You&rsquo;re here!  That means I&rsquo;ve managed to convert my site (back) over to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  In the interest of making progress, I had to cut some corners.  Currently, that manifests itself as taking my old weblogs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Man vs. Machine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Punchline Labs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> offline while I figure out how to rejigger the content into WordPress.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don&rsquo;t stop reading!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Yet Another Boy-Have-I-Been-Busy But Now I Promise To Post More&rdquo; post!</p>
<p>The decision to switch (back) to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is bittersweet.  I&rsquo;d originally switched away to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Typo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but that didn&rsquo;t work out well.  On the one hand, Typo went a little sideways, requiring me to poke the database a little before I could post.  On the other hand, running a big Rails app like Typo on shared hosting like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextDrive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> isn&rsquo;t a recipe for reliability.  So a change was necessary.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Point: you&rsquo;re cooler if you write your own weblog software.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Its been pointed out that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jedi build their own lightsabers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and thus, so should programmers.  I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful idea and I subscribe to it where I can.  However, it&rsquo;s an idea at one end of a spectrum of pragmatism and I need to live at the other end.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Counter-point: the writing is more important than the gizmos.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  To a point, writing my own weblog software is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->yak shaving<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  In fact, I&rsquo;ve contemplated switching weblogs, hosts and a myriad of other choices for month.  Thus, with a cleanly shorn yak and nothing to show for it, I finally jumped in the pool and switched.  And now, I can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->write<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Awesome!</p>
<p>The writing here is the most important thing.  Not so much whether I&rsquo;ve got Ruby cred because I run a Ruby-powered weblog, web cred because I skipped using widgets to pull in some content rather than hacking it in (I went with widgets) or design cred because I built my own theme.  Very few people will come back on those strengths alone.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Its the writing stupid!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Thus, I&rsquo;m re-aligning development choices based on removing friction from writing.</p>
<p>I think I made a reasonable choice going with WordPress and hacking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DePo Clean<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  In the end, I just want something that lets me write whatever and whenever I want with as little friction as possible.  WordPress fits that maxim.  Plus I think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matt Mullenweg<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the rest of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Automattic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> team have pretty good taste, and I can get behind that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So, what have we learned?</p>

			 <p>On a whim, I took a shallow dive into the world of C this weekend.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Its been a long time since I delved into C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I ended up spending nearly as much time tweaking a build script with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ever-amusing Rake<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as I did remembering my C skillz[1].  In the end, my goal was to write a simple program that just reads a file and writes it back out.  Nothing <code>cat</code> couldn&rsquo;t handle, sure, but you gotta start somewhere.</p>
<p>Of course, the first thing you&rsquo;ll notice when you go from Ruby on Friday to C on Saturday is that <em>OMG I have to write fourteen-billion lines of code just to open a file?</em>  Well, yeah, you do.  But the language isn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> awful.  Munging file pointers, getting buffer sizes by <code>stat</code>ing a filename and all that, it&rsquo;s kinda fun.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not fun?  Managing memory.  It&rsquo;d be fun if it wasn&rsquo;t just an express ticket on the memory leak train.  So lots of people have tried to tackle this.  I was playing with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apache Portable Runtime<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or APR, in concert with all this C and they take an interesting tack in dealing with memory.</p>

<p>In the APR world, your application creates one or more <em>pools</em> that you then allocate memory from.  You create a &ldquo;root&rdquo; memory pool to start off with, but you can create as many further pools as you like.</p>
<p>The idea is that as you transition from one area of functionality to another, you create a new pool.  Once you&rsquo;re done with that function, you destroy the pool and all the memory allocated to it goes away.  Including the stuff you forgot about.  Which is kinda rad, it being the case that memory leaks are leaks of (human) memory.</p>
<p>This made me think of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->generational garbage collection<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Java&rsquo;s garbage collector does this clever trick where objects are initially created in a &ldquo;nursery&rdquo; with all the other recently created objects.  Since it&rsquo;s typical that objects are created and then quickly discarded, the nursery is basically the low-hanging fruit for the garbage collector to find memory when it needs to.</p>
<h2 id="bring-that-funk-back-over-here">Bring that funk back over here</h2>
<p>Seems to me you could do the same thing with the APR&rsquo;s pools.  Create a new memory pool for every request, for example.  Then when you&rsquo;re done with the request, just delete the pool and don&rsquo;t worry.  The APR folks list examples of assigning pools to starting your application, parsing the configuration and then doing your actual processing.  That sounds reasonable to me too.</p>
<p>This is probably not rocket science.  In fact, the developers of the APR readily acknowledge that tuning your app to work with this approach to memory management is the trickiest and most contentious[2] facet of developing with the APR.  In the next release, they&rsquo;re working on an alternative, just in case pools aren&rsquo;t your thing.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I find it pleasing that the world of C seems to have, perhaps, moved on from &ldquo;man up and manage your own memory, <em>we are C programmers!</em>&rdquo; to &ldquo;hey man, everyone has trouble with this stuff, give this approach a try!&rdquo;  At some point, with some problems, C becomes a necessity.  Anything that helps that out is moving the bar higher for the practice of programming.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Best obituary ever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A shame, then, that he is now, in the words of Monty Python, an ex-parrot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alex The Parrot was adopted by a scientist who wasn&rsquo;t, at the time, involved in linguistics.  But, in teaching Alex to speak, she ended up teaching him things like counting and basic recognition of objects.  Over the years, this evolved into all manners of experiments on what kind of cognition Alex was capable of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the end, said Dr Pepperberg, Alex had the intelligence of a five-year-old child and had not reached his full potential. He had a vocabulary of 150 words. He knew the names of 50 objects and could, in addition, describe their colours, shapes and the materials they were made from. He could answer questions about objects' properties, even when he had not seen that particular combination of properties before. He could ask for things - and would reject a proffered item and ask again if it was not what he wanted. He understood, and could discuss, the concepts of &ldquo;bigger&rdquo;, &ldquo;smaller&rdquo;, &ldquo;same&rdquo; and &ldquo;different&rdquo;. And he could count up to six, including the number zero (and was grappling with the concept of &ldquo;seven&rdquo; when he died). He even knew when and how to apologise if he annoyed Dr Pepperberg or her collaborators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Animals are just amazing.</p>
